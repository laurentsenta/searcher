## List all the products, tools, and companies discussed

- IPNI: a content-addressed index used across IPFS and Filecoin networks
- double hashing: a technique for ensuring reader privacy in IPNI
- seed.contact: a service that has trillions of CIDs indexed
- libp2p pubsub: used for announcing new data being available
- Pebble: a key-value data store used in seed.contact
- AWS: hosting for the DHStore and DHFind instances
- DHStore: a service introduced for double hashing in IPNI responsible for storing binary keys mapped to binary values
- DHFind: a service introduced for handling regular (non-double-hashed) requests
- CockroachDB: a commercial product using Pebble

## List all the weak signals of things an almighty AI could do to improve the presenter's life

- Implementing reader and writer privacy optimizations in IPNI to eliminate the need for manual adjustments and monitoring
- Identifying better-performing data stores than Pebble for faster ingestion and indexing
- Simplifying migration of existing data within the IPNI system while maintaining privacy-preserving aspects
- Streamlining debugging and monitoring tools for working with encrypted data for various index providers and operators
- Possibly providing access to a shared S3 mirror containing advertisement chains for faster index rebuilding

## List all the weak signals of things that are already great in the presenter's life

- The implementation of double hashing in IPNI ensuring reader privacy
- seed.contact being used extensively for indexing content in IPFS and Filecoin networks
- Pebble providing relatively good write throughput and performance for the IPNI system
- Introducing new services like DHStore and DHFind for better handling of both double hashed and regular requests
- Working collaboratively with other team members on improvements like the S3 mirroring capability and additional metrics for performance monitoring
