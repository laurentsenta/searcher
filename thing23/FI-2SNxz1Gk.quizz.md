## List all the products, tools, and companies discussed

- IPFS: a protocol and network designed to make the web faster and more robust, emphasizing content-addressing with verifiability at the endpoints and arbitrary transports.

## List all the weak signals of things an almighty AI could do to improve the presenter's life

- Help to identify new IPFS principles as the system evolves and grows, ensuring that it remains cohesive and compatible with various implementations.
- Provide assistance in cleaning up and maintaining robustness in network protocols and systems that have previously suffered from less stringent implementation practices.

## List all the weak signals of things that are already great in the presenter's life

- The development of IPFS already provides new robustness principles that are better than previous web protocols, ensuring verifiability at the endpoints while allowing for tolerance in the middle.
