1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:12,160
Okay, hey everyone! I minimally prepared for this because of things, but we are so excited


2
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:24,080
to announce IPFS Camp 2023 as we talked about. And we decided on Bangalore, India, November


3
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:31,920
3rd through 5th. And so super excited about that. But the purpose of this kind of workshop


4
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:38,240
discussion time is to really focus on bringing in more people who are interested in helping


5
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:48,040
us gather content for IPFS Camp and help build the organizing team. And so we could do a


6
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:55,520
quick retro of IPFS Camp from last year. We did one briefly, but it'd be just to refresh


7
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:59,720
our recollection of what we thought went well and what didn't go well and what we'd like


8
00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:02,920
to have for next year.


9
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:08,640
So we thought we could do it, one way of doing this is I have this slide, I'll share it in


10
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:13,840
our general Slack. We could all use these stickies. I haven't shared the link yet, I'll


11
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:19,080
just do it right after. We could use the stickies to sort of take inputs from everyone sitting


12
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:25,680
over here, do the retro, followed by what are our goals and objectives, and then followed


13
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:32,480
by brainstorming what tracks do we want. But this is a way of doing this. If anyone here


14
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:38,400
has a better idea, we are open to that. Otherwise, I'll share the link right away and we can


15
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:39,400
get started.


16
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:46,080
Cool. So the box over there links to the recap blog. If you just want to give yourself a


17
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:52,240
quick refresh on what happened at IPFS Camp last time, maybe take a look at that blog.


18
00:01:52,240 --> 00:02:00,400
We'll wait for about five minutes. And yeah, you all can just like input, pick one of those


19
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:07,840
stickies and put your thoughts and then we will discuss.


20
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:21,480
Okay, cool. I will do a quick recap of maybe let's fix things first and respond to a couple


21
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:28,120
of them that we already know we can. Yeah, Lisbon was 14 days. This one's not going to


22
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:36,040
be 14 days. It'll be three days of IPFS Camp. Plus this is not yet announced, but two days


23
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:45,160
of Phil Bangalore and maybe one more day, but that's about it. But this is it, like


24
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:59,560
seriously. However, we do expect that once we start promotions for IPFS Camp, other events


25
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:06,080
locally might come up as like side events around the same duration. So just FYI. But


26
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:12,720
I doubt it will be 14 days this time. So I do not doubt that it will not be 14 days this


27
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:22,600
time. And cool. More hacking time together, more workshops plus bounties. I think they


28
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:29,680
are both like similar, so I'll put them close to each other. More intro to IPFS talks. Yeah,


29
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:37,280
I think that's very relevant given the audience we will have. Implementers, builders, but


30
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:44,280
few users represented. Get NFT platforms. Okay. More substantial job fair, longer expo


31
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:52,200
and better scholars programming. Okay. And in the good things, lightning talks track,


32
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:57,720
giving back to the local community. Things content. We did some things content, include


33
00:03:57,720 --> 00:04:04,760
that and recruit more contributors. 450 people. Oh, this time we'll definitely have more people.


34
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:11,400
Lip P2P track was great. Super well attended. And multiple tracks for beginners plus. Okay,


35
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:17,880
cool. Beatbox guy, we'll definitely have some equivalent entertainment version for that.


36
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:26,320
Okay, cool. I think this is great. And with this in mind, maybe let's think about what


37
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:34,680
are the broad goals and objectives we want to accomplish with IPFS camp this year. Probably


38
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:44,120
keeping in mind the keynote summary we saw yesterday on how can actually IPFS camp help


39
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:53,360
sort of magnify the outcomes of the action items we decided on yesterday. Yeah. Let's


40
00:04:53,360 --> 00:05:01,000
maybe keep this to three minutes plus two minutes in case people want to expand.


41
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:07,600
I think one of the things that we saw at last IPFS camp was a lot of new people. And we


42
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:12,600
had some content for new folks, but even that, a lot of the feedback was that even that was


43
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:19,120
still too high of a barrier for them to climb and very, very technical for the level at


44
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:24,960
which they were entering. So I think a really clear path for very new beginner people, maybe


45
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:30,280
even folks who are learning how to code like a separate small track for that level of people


46
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:33,400
that are getting involved doing their first application or first web app, things like


47
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:36,000
that with IPFS.


48
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:43,440
Yeah. In very much the same vein, I mean, I think it's sort of like the same brainwave,


49
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:49,040
but that like one thing that I often find difficult to explain to people, and I think


50
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:54,080
that reflects on the same thing is like, what is this whole space? What are the things that


51
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:59,880
you can be doing with it? And so sort of like the 30,000 feet view of everything, and maybe


52
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:04,440
this is how you choose your own adventure in this space is something that could help


53
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:06,440
onboard people.


54
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:13,080
Yeah, I think riffing on that, I ended up putting philosophy of IPFS up there. Like,


55
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:21,800
what are we trying to do rather than just another weird system to make a web app with?


56
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:30,840
And that maybe links well with the like, get more nodes running as well. So those two could


57
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:40,040
be fitting together. Because ideally, and maybe along with that, I put onboard new OSS


58
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:46,640
contributors, right? Like, what is the impact beyond that? But also, and this is really


59
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:54,840
maybe your next talk, everywhere we do one of these, we should leave behind a thriving


60
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:58,240
IPFS community.


61
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:05,240
I put in a couple of points in there too. The ones that start with communicate is all


62
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:14,880
me. Because I think we seriously need to communicate better and about all the exciting stuff we


63
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:23,600
are doing. One insight, so I was talking to like developers from India, sort of preparing


64
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:29,920
like, what are their motivations, etc. Like trying to understand that. And one insight


65
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:37,320
was that, you know, IPFS was really cool when it started. And now it's just something that


66
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:42,880
the people who know about it use it like, you know, either through a pinning service


67
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:47,240
or like, but there are not a lot of people engaging with all the new developments that


68
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:54,000
are happening. So we need to do like, we need to be able to like communicate everything


69
00:07:54,000 --> 00:08:05,080
that's happening better. And sort of similar to expand core protocol contributors is also


70
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:14,480
making sure we get, they know what to contribute to. So it'll be the roadmap for all the different


71
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:21,840
implementations that we have or the other projects that are being built in the ecosystem.


72
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:29,080
Okay. Is there anything else anyone would like to add to the goals here?


73
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:35,280
I mean, the one thing I'd note is that I find it remarkable just like how aligned all of


74
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:40,360
these are. They're very much in the same space. So I think that's a pretty good sign.


75
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:49,080
Yeah. I have a question on this one. Every attendee votes on IE awards.


76
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:54,360
So the impact evaluator awards were a vote that we did for, we did the first round of


77
00:08:54,360 --> 00:09:00,160
awards at the last IPFS thing. And then we did the next round at this one and we had


78
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:08,000
people vote, but we actually had, given there was almost 150 people here, we had about half


79
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:14,640
that number of people actually vote. And I think, and maybe that's just actually a articulation


80
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:21,480
of a higher level goal, which is these events should result in community participation and


81
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:27,960
engagement in what the IPFS ecosystem actually is. And I think the impact evaluator awards


82
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:33,480
are a way for the community to participate in determining its own future and what gets


83
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:38,520
funded, what gets acknowledged, what gets rewarded for being created and that is value.


84
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:46,280
And there's a signal in there about how, is that set of things to be voted on the right


85
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:50,800
set of things? If there's low participation, then maybe we're not getting the right set


86
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:54,920
of things in there. And so I think there's that participation in that process is a really


87
00:09:54,920 --> 00:10:01,040
good way of measuring the health of the community, showing how much the people that are putting


88
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:04,560
on these events and setting up those awards are in touch with what community needs are,


89
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:08,200
do we have the right people participating? So that I've just kind of threw that in there


90
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:15,000
as a, if we can get everybody who registers to also vote, then we might get a better sense


91
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:20,520
of some of those things. Yeah. And also I think it's an important way of


92
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:25,480
putting money where our mouth is. Like, I mean, very literally in this case, it's like,


93
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:29,400
when we say that we want community to drive this thing, it's like, well, here, here's


94
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:33,560
a pool of money. You go like, drive where it goes. I think that that's a very important


95
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:38,240
message to try to like get as many people to notice.


96
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:44,040
I have a, like, it's not a problem, but there is a difficulty in actually being able to


97
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:51,920
execute this because not everyone ends up looking at all the projects and the question


98
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:57,120
and the emphasis is on all the projects. So even if everyone ends up voting, like, how


99
00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:02,600
do we make sure that if there's like a hundred projects submitted to this, how, why, what's


100
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:06,840
the motivation for people to actually look at them before they vote?


101
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:12,040
I mean, I don't think we should expect everyone to look at every project, but so long as the


102
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:16,920
way in which people get to see projects is reasonably random and they're not all exposed


103
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:23,120
to the same three projects that everyone's going to vote on. I think that's fine. Yeah.


104
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:34,920
Okay. Cool. So maybe a good way of like summarizing the goals and objectives. We can club these


105
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:39,440
tickies that are in the similar zone. I'll just like take 30 seconds to do that right


106
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:52,240
now. Okay. So it looks like grow the number of new developers in the IPFS ecosystem. That's


107
00:11:52,240 --> 00:12:03,720
one goal. The left group of stickies. What's a good way of summarizing the second bucket?


108
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:09,800
Philosophy of IPFS deployment production group track. And yeah. Can someone help me here?


109
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:19,840
I don't know how to summarize this group. The second one. Oh yeah. This one.


110
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:28,000
In the middle? Yeah, the middle one. Like philosophy of IPFS, deployment production


111
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:31,680
grouper track and get more nodes running. Like what's a good way of...


112
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:39,160
I mean, I think philosophy goes with communicates, you know, on board. I don't know.


113
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:45,520
I put philosophy in there of like, you're like, this is what you do. This is what it's


114
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:52,920
about. This is the long-term plan. Every human on the planet can store stuff online effectively


115
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:57,640
for free, effectively forever. And then it's like, that's super exciting. How do I get


116
00:12:57,640 --> 00:13:02,400
started? You should run a node. And they're like, okay, I'm running a janky little home


117
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:08,640
node or running IPFS desktop. But, and then it's like, oh, here's how you like run it


118
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:20,240
for real at the library or something is kind of how I was thinking about it. But why, how


119
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:31,280
and ouch. Yeah. Why, how and ouch. Can you note those tracks?


120
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:39,000
I'm actually going to write that down. I was serious.


121
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:48,640
Yeah. Okay. And then the last group is I think clear and simplified communication of our,


122
00:13:48,640 --> 00:14:06,280
of the key takeaways from IPFS thing actually. Right? Okay. If we go to the next slide, that's


123
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:16,560
where I'm typing those down. Okay. Does this, do we, I mean, we can iterate again on this


124
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:31,040
later, but does this look good so far to everyone or is there something major we are missing?


125
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:34,040
And a great experience. The idli sambar goes there.


126
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:47,880
I think the objective ultimately is like activating India. Activate India.


127
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:51,880
Yep. Okay.


128
00:14:51,880 --> 00:15:09,080
This hasn't really been in the camps in the past, but like, sorry, this hasn't really


129
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:17,440
been in the, in the, in the past, but what does it look like to engage with local civil


130
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:26,160
society, not just young hackers, right? Like what, what does it look like to connect at


131
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:30,480
the state level or the national level? You know, like if we're going to be flying a bunch


132
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:34,480
of people from around the world to there, are there some other discussions that we can


133
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:40,720
have face to face or showcase? That's like compliance, Robin.


134
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:47,360
Yeah. Yeah. Open question. I don't think you have to put it in an objective.


135
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:53,920
Okay. Let's actually, that's a good thing to discuss right now. Any other open questions


136
00:15:53,920 --> 00:16:02,120
people have? Because I think it would impact the goals and objectives of the event. So


137
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:08,360
any other open questions? One is engage with the local community.


138
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:20,480
Oh, all right. Builders on versus contributors too. Yeah.


139
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:32,080
Yeah. 100%. And I feel like the other question there is within those two subgroups also,


140
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:40,520
is like how familiar someone is to IPFS and like overall programming, like experience


141
00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:45,600
level, right? So our tracks have to be able to cater to either we, either we communicate


142
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:56,320
this is only for X type of folks or we program for everyone who turns up.


143
00:16:56,320 --> 00:17:23,400
Okay. Okay. Let's look at the slide again and see if we are missing anything major.


144
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:28,560
Project India philosophy of IPFS. Grow the number of new developers in the ecosystem.


145
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:42,120
Simple and clear communication of key takeaways from IPFS thing and then a great event experience.


146
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:59,680
Okay. Okay. And I think with that, we can open to just like brainstorming on the content


147
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:09,440
we should have at IPFS camp. It need not necessarily translate into a track, but yeah, let's maybe


148
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:15,320
use the next slide. How much more time do we have? 15 minutes?


149
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:21,520
I think we have quite a lot of time. Okay. Okay. Yeah. So yeah. Next step, let's


150
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:29,120
read the objectives again. Add more questions if we think we have more questions. Oops.


151
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:37,560
Yeah. And yeah. And then let's start putting in ideas on the stickies in the next slides


152
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:45,920
on what we think should be covered in the content we do. So it's just like dump ideas


153
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:52,600
there like small, big, not great, great. All of them.


154
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:57,000
I had a bunch of different ones. Some are ones that we've already had. Like we've had


155
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:01,480
IPFS everywhere, but we didn't really focus on the hard and the why and why they're hard


156
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:05,320
and how to get there. So it could be that we have a new track about like, we kind of


157
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:10,000
called it integrating IPFS, covered some of that this time around, but I'm really focusing


158
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:16,600
on like a track about IOT or a track about mobile or not underwater really, but IPFS


159
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:23,000
in space as a track, right? Could be. And then I added another one, this track of doing


160
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:29,320
stuff with IPFS that might not even be technical. That might be using applications that support


161
00:19:29,320 --> 00:19:35,360
IPFS. So people have this experience of, Oh, I made this thing, or I published this data


162
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:40,920
or like a group writing session where everybody publishes their, their, what they wrote on


163
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:52,200
the IPFS. So not necessarily coding, but actually using it, uh, IPFS as a user.


164
00:19:52,200 --> 00:20:00,040
Okay. I also love the how to hold your own IPFS community events.


165
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:24,740
and I added like a superset track there next to that, like the train, the trainer, like how do we teach people to be better? Uh, speakers at events and train them how to do good decks for teaching how to code or doing their thing. I think those types of things really help energize and activate a community. So that could be under the like activate India. So that, that community leaves with a bunch of new skills about how to continue doing that work.


166
00:20:24,740 --> 00:20:28,940
And a list of people who speak the native languages there. Right.


167
00:20:28,940 --> 00:20:57,940
Um, yeah. Although you want, uh, like developers generally speak English, so I don't think we will face any language barriers. I mean, we did fill Bangalore last year and all the talks were in English and or the entire audience was like perfectly comfortable understanding all of it and interacting with the speakers. So I mean, it would be fun to know and to like, and hear some of the languages.


168
00:20:57,940 --> 00:21:10,600
We could throw it in as an experience, but it's not like one thing that we do get though is that means that the people, the people that aren't English comfortable did show up, but it doesn't mean that people that weren't English comfortable, weren't interested in might've come.


169
00:21:11,020 --> 00:21:21,780
Um, so one thing that we get requests in our, uh, localization platform, it's people request like IPFS companion or IPFS.io or docs, IPFS in different languages.


170
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:43,620
And so it could be that we have a localization track where, yeah, where people, you know, group together. If we come out with a group, a working group that say are the leaders of a given language, they're like, Hey, I'm the lead for Bengali and we will translate the docs website or the IPFS, the Helia examples repo or things like this into a language. Sure. Specs. Fine.


171
00:21:43,620 --> 00:22:00,420
That could be part of the train, the trainers track to write just one of the call outs of action. It's like if you really care and you want to learn how to run a community event and you speak one of these languages, you know, consider being a localization resource, right?


172
00:22:00,420 --> 00:22:23,780
It's one of those things that I actually care a lot about, although I don't do a lot of work on, but yeah, there's nothing cooler than to go to an open source event somewhere in the world and realize that you're in the room and you're giving a presentation in English and there's a group huddled in the back with somebody who's translating it in real time.


173
00:22:23,780 --> 00:22:33,460
Like I've seen this multiple times and then they sit down and they're coding in their native language and that's when you realize you're getting outside of our little bubble.


174
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:34,820
Yeah.


175
00:22:35,420 --> 00:22:35,580
Yeah.


176
00:22:35,580 --> 00:22:37,940
That, uh, that gives me an idea.


177
00:22:37,940 --> 00:22:43,300
We could probably have a developer influencers track or like group.


178
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:44,340
No, it's the thing.


179
00:22:44,340 --> 00:22:55,020
Like there are, there are college students who actually have YouTube channels with thousands and thousands of followers and people follow them and I see Mohammed smiling there.


180
00:22:55,020 --> 00:22:55,900
Do you know one of them?


181
00:22:59,060 --> 00:22:59,380
Yeah.


182
00:22:59,380 --> 00:23:02,460
So there are, there are like, um, people who do that.


183
00:23:05,660 --> 00:23:07,060
That made me think about something else.


184
00:23:07,060 --> 00:23:08,220
Like, what about accessibility?


185
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:08,740
Right.


186
00:23:09,140 --> 00:23:11,140
Um, have we been thinking about that enough?


187
00:23:11,140 --> 00:23:15,260
Cause like maybe even more so than, uh, cultural diversity.


188
00:23:15,300 --> 00:23:19,820
I don't think we've been thinking enough about like different barriers for people who are disabled, like ASL.


189
00:23:19,820 --> 00:23:22,340
Like what if we have developers who are hearing impaired?


190
00:23:22,700 --> 00:23:29,420
How can we make sure that they can participate in, you know, the different events also for the show and tell talk to me.


191
00:23:29,420 --> 00:23:41,540
I mean, you think about, um, like a maker's track, right?


192
00:23:41,540 --> 00:23:47,180
And that could be a way to include a wider range of people who are not just developers into the space.


193
00:23:47,500 --> 00:23:57,620
Cause I don't think as far as like creatives, artists, and people who could potentially make IPFS attractive and marketable are, um, a big part of the community right now.


194
00:23:57,620 --> 00:24:03,260
It's like core technical people who are cool to us, but may not be interesting to the wider public.


195
00:24:04,020 --> 00:24:16,500
So thinking about like just different wearables or IOT or digital art, different ways that IPFS could be integrated, it could be a way to get a bigger group of people into IPFS community.


196
00:24:18,780 --> 00:24:19,100
Yeah.


197
00:24:19,260 --> 00:24:21,420
A subset of that group is also designers.


198
00:24:21,420 --> 00:24:27,660
I keep hearing from teams that are like building products, like we need good designers.


199
00:24:27,700 --> 00:24:29,100
They don't come to Web3.


200
00:24:30,060 --> 00:24:30,340
Yeah.


201
00:24:30,340 --> 00:24:47,620
I mean, even when we're talking about, uh, NFT artists and making their own platforms, like to me, it would be great to have a whole talk on how could you build your own platform in IPFS, deploying your smart contract on FEVM, being able to, you know, retain a large percentage of your, um, margin, your profit margins for your art.


202
00:24:47,940 --> 00:24:49,620
Um, I think that would all be interesting.


203
00:24:49,620 --> 00:24:56,100
Um, yeah, I mean, it's just a lot, a lot of ways we can include a wider range of people.


204
00:24:59,460 --> 00:24:59,900
Okay.


205
00:25:00,460 --> 00:25:03,180
Um, I'll put it in the next slide.


206
00:25:05,180 --> 00:25:05,660
Okay.


207
00:25:10,580 --> 00:25:17,380
Um, one track I would love to see, um, based off some of the talks I saw this year would be IPFS and privacy.


208
00:25:17,380 --> 00:25:25,780
Um, specifically between, you know, fissions work on private and permission data on IPFS and the sort of reader privacy work in the DHT.


209
00:25:26,620 --> 00:25:39,780
Um, I work with a lot of activist organizations at the foundation who, uh, you don't have use cases where they care a lot about privacy and, and potentially a lot of misconceptions about how private the network actually is, um, for a lot of their content.


210
00:25:39,780 --> 00:25:50,940
Okay. Any other ideas?


211
00:25:50,980 --> 00:25:58,140
This is the time where you imagine you have a magic wand and you can get whatever you want at IPFS Camp this year.


212
00:26:01,940 --> 00:26:02,220
Okay.


213
00:26:02,220 --> 00:26:05,300
I put in a few ideas as well on the second slide there.


214
00:26:05,300 --> 00:26:21,900
Um, one was office hours, uh, with operators, uh, basically the community that is here right now, because I feel like talking to the community that is at IPFS thing would be a huge value add.


215
00:26:21,900 --> 00:26:29,780
Like getting those one-on-one conversations, uh, would be a huge value add for like developers, uh, who are new to the ecosystem.


216
00:26:30,420 --> 00:26:34,300
Um, all day dosa.


217
00:26:34,340 --> 00:26:34,580
Yeah.


218
00:26:34,580 --> 00:26:34,860
Yeah.


219
00:26:34,860 --> 00:26:38,020
That's, uh, it's, it's illegal if we don't have that.


220
00:26:38,020 --> 00:26:38,540
So.


221
00:26:42,980 --> 00:26:43,380
Sorry.


222
00:26:44,180 --> 00:26:44,820
I'm sorry.


223
00:26:44,860 --> 00:26:49,420
Uh, I wanted to speak to the wind bounties and internships track.


224
00:26:49,460 --> 00:26:59,700
So, um, no JS interactive conference typically does like they have bugs and issues that are printed out on little paper slips that they hand out.


225
00:26:59,700 --> 00:27:11,820
Um, and then they have like a group of SMEs subject matter experts walking around to help people on like interacting with development, trying to solve actual bugs.


226
00:27:11,820 --> 00:27:25,380
Like we have help wanted tasks out there and we point people there, but having that session interactive during the conference, I think would be really useful because a lot of people look at those issues and then are overwhelmed because it is overwhelming.


227
00:27:25,380 --> 00:27:26,580
It's a huge ecosystem.


228
00:27:26,580 --> 00:27:28,900
So I think that would be really cool.


229
00:27:28,900 --> 00:27:29,100
Yeah.


230
00:27:29,100 --> 00:27:30,460
I think that's a great idea.


231
00:27:30,820 --> 00:27:33,780
Like plus 100 cool.


232
00:27:34,340 --> 00:27:34,620
Yeah.


233
00:27:34,780 --> 00:27:35,340
Okay.


234
00:27:35,540 --> 00:27:35,860
Yeah.


235
00:27:36,620 --> 00:27:38,020
Um, yeah.


236
00:27:38,620 --> 00:27:50,020
And that's, yeah, I think I was trying to go for something similar when I say, I put up the digital matchmaking wall idea, like just like match open problems to build us.


237
00:27:50,020 --> 00:27:58,540
Like, you know, imagine if there was a wall where you have a, like you could submit a problem and then somebody could be like, Hey, that problem is interesting.


238
00:27:58,540 --> 00:27:59,380
I want to solve it.


239
00:27:59,540 --> 00:28:02,540
Who do I find to be able to like solve it together to collaborate?


240
00:28:03,060 --> 00:28:09,900
So yeah, I think, I think both these ideas can marry and become something that's very meaningful for attendees.


241
00:28:11,380 --> 00:28:11,580
Okay.


242
00:28:11,580 --> 00:28:13,740
For the digital matchmaking wall.


243
00:28:13,740 --> 00:28:21,980
Like a lot of, a lot of times, like even at this conference, you know, we have the unconference where, you know, sometimes there's a little planning ahead of time.


244
00:28:21,980 --> 00:28:28,180
Sometimes there's not, but it like is just all culminated, culminated into one single like timeframe.


245
00:28:28,460 --> 00:28:39,060
I think it would be good to have that be persistent throughout the conference where you have that wall available at first day, all the way to the last day where people can say like, this is a problem.


246
00:28:39,060 --> 00:28:48,700
Like this is a problem people can maybe put on there, like I am a potential solver of this problem and I am a potential potential, you know, beneficiary of this problem.


247
00:28:48,740 --> 00:28:54,300
Like, so then you find all the groups trying to solve the same problem and all the people who might be able to solve that problem.


248
00:28:54,660 --> 00:29:02,460
And then maybe provide, they provide their own contact info or like facilitate them getting in touch and actually meeting at some point.


249
00:29:02,460 --> 00:29:09,140
But having that available the whole time, I think could be really cool instead of just like one on unconf that then ends.


250
00:29:09,140 --> 00:29:09,340
Yeah.


251
00:29:09,340 --> 00:29:13,340
You know, I think this wall is a good social graph idea, right?


252
00:29:13,580 --> 00:29:18,420
Like you could just build an event app for this just to be able to like do this.


253
00:29:21,060 --> 00:29:21,420
Okay.


254
00:29:21,860 --> 00:29:24,060
And yeah.


255
00:29:29,180 --> 00:29:31,540
I think it would just be like a Trello board, right?


256
00:29:31,540 --> 00:29:33,220
A Trello board with like the different needs.


257
00:29:33,220 --> 00:29:33,900
Trouble board.


258
00:29:33,980 --> 00:29:34,580
Yeah.


259
00:29:34,740 --> 00:29:37,820
And then just like different needs of startups or companies in the space.


260
00:29:37,860 --> 00:29:42,700
And then as people want to pick up those needs, just pick up the sticky note and move it to doing.


261
00:29:42,700 --> 00:29:52,020
And then you could like spin that up really quickly or it could potentially even be something that's like created on IPFS that's a reiteration of Trello.


262
00:29:53,420 --> 00:29:53,860
Yeah.


263
00:29:55,060 --> 00:29:57,820
Trouble makers board also sounds nice, right?


264
00:30:00,620 --> 00:30:00,980
Yeah.


265
00:30:00,980 --> 00:30:02,620
No, but I think that's a good idea.


266
00:30:03,300 --> 00:30:04,220
Okay, cool.


267
00:30:04,620 --> 00:30:06,980
Any other ideas?


268
00:30:17,780 --> 00:30:30,900
I, one of the challenges in these events is oftentimes we're using software to do the event or to talk about the event or to talk to each other at the event that doesn't actually reflect our values or use our


269
00:30:30,900 --> 00:30:31,380
stuff.


270
00:30:31,740 --> 00:30:43,340
And I wonder if there's some like focus on, on a dog footing, like the, an outcome of, of the thing that replacing the things that we would otherwise use that aren't typing for us.


271
00:30:44,740 --> 00:30:46,660
Like a decentralized Slack.


272
00:30:46,900 --> 00:30:47,420
Sure.


273
00:30:47,420 --> 00:30:58,740
Or even like a calendaring thing, or like you just said, an event app or, you know, something like that, but just that theme, not event specifically just for the things that we do every day.


274
00:30:58,740 --> 00:31:00,260
Got it.


275
00:31:00,260 --> 00:31:00,780
Okay.


276
00:31:00,820 --> 00:31:01,340
Yeah.


277
00:31:01,340 --> 00:31:06,260
So we have a lot of ideas here.


278
00:31:06,300 --> 00:31:17,460
I'm not going to club them live right now, but would be great if people can just like, if throughout the rest of the event, you'd come up with like more ideas, just like dump them here.


279
00:31:17,460 --> 00:31:33,780
I also want to maybe reflect on all the tracks we had last year and see if we want to redo some of them or not do some of them or do them differently this time.


280
00:31:34,140 --> 00:31:39,700
So maybe we just like go track by track and comment on each track.


281
00:31:39,700 --> 00:31:49,420
So the way we'll do this is possibly we pass it on the mic for each of the tracks, and then I'll just like make notes with everybody's comments on it.


282
00:31:50,260 --> 00:31:53,740
So the first one is keynotes.


283
00:31:54,460 --> 00:31:56,260
I think the objective slide.


284
00:31:56,260 --> 00:31:58,420
Nah, cancel.


285
00:32:04,060 --> 00:32:05,380
There's really a lot of tracks.


286
00:32:05,380 --> 00:32:09,020
I'm wondering if like passing the mic around might be a pretty rough way to do this.


287
00:32:09,020 --> 00:32:11,660
Do you want to do it the slide way again?


288
00:32:12,100 --> 00:32:14,060
Yeah, that might be good.


289
00:32:14,100 --> 00:32:20,700
And actually, because I think one of the things we probably want, and I don't know if we have the right people in the room for, is the track leads.


290
00:32:20,980 --> 00:32:21,460
Yes.


291
00:32:21,460 --> 00:32:25,300
Because they'll give the kind of like the retro on that.


292
00:32:25,540 --> 00:32:28,060
So might need to do this one async.


293
00:32:28,220 --> 00:32:28,900
Yeah, I think.


294
00:32:28,900 --> 00:32:29,380
Okay.


295
00:32:30,620 --> 00:32:32,820
Okay, then that just leaves the track leads.


296
00:32:32,820 --> 00:32:39,180
I think if we have keynotes and browsers and platforms, we're good.


297
00:32:39,180 --> 00:32:41,180
Thank you for that.


298
00:32:43,740 --> 00:32:54,980
Some of the, I think a retro on IPFS thing would also be really good because some of these we did like computer over data and measurement performance browsers like data transfer, content route.


299
00:32:56,140 --> 00:33:00,580
Actually, yeah, so far everything in the screen are also tracks we had here.


300
00:33:00,580 --> 00:33:01,580
Yeah.


301
00:33:01,580 --> 00:33:02,580
Okay.


302
00:33:02,580 --> 00:33:16,940
So then, so then what we'll do is we'll just look at the retro we did yesterday once more and then come back with like a recommendation for async comments.


303
00:33:16,940 --> 00:33:21,300
And then possibly also keep the like apply for a track option open, right?


304
00:33:21,300 --> 00:33:22,300
Once we announce the event.


305
00:33:22,300 --> 00:33:23,140
Absolutely.


306
00:33:23,140 --> 00:33:29,700
That was one of the things that I was going to say is super important in order to meet the needs of the community of people that will be coming.


307
00:33:29,700 --> 00:33:30,700
Yeah.


308
00:33:30,700 --> 00:33:35,460
Is creating as wide a possible vector for that input as early as possible.


309
00:33:35,460 --> 00:33:42,980
So a lot of these are kind of curated and specific to the core implementers and builders and don't really map to that larger audience.


310
00:33:42,980 --> 00:33:49,700
Like I think it's fascinating that the list of track ideas that we did at the beginning is so far away from this list.


311
00:33:49,700 --> 00:34:00,820
And that's, I think something that might be interesting too, from an organizer standpoint is asking the question, being really clear, what is the difference between camp and thing?


312
00:34:02,380 --> 00:34:05,780
And so it's a very different audience and they'll have different needs.


313
00:34:05,780 --> 00:34:23,780
I think there's an opportunity to bring a bunch more other organizations that have commercial offerings, their own protocols and a bunch of other things in here that isn't really represented necessarily.


314
00:34:23,780 --> 00:34:35,780
And really like we want to invite people who are using IPFS as a platform and succeeding as a platform.


315
00:34:35,780 --> 00:34:40,780
Again, we want to curate it, make sure it's like, okay, so what are you doing that's like actually connected to IPFS?


316
00:34:40,780 --> 00:34:42,780
But we want to showcase that.


317
00:34:42,780 --> 00:34:44,780
Yeah, absolutely.


318
00:34:44,780 --> 00:34:50,780
In fact, some of those people, there are a couple of PLN, a few PLN companies based in India.


319
00:34:50,780 --> 00:34:54,780
I am hoping to have them as like organizers.


320
00:34:54,780 --> 00:35:00,780
So I'll be like reaching out to them to help us because it's going to be a lot of people.


321
00:35:00,780 --> 00:35:02,780
We need a lot of local support.


322
00:35:02,780 --> 00:35:05,780
So I think that's it.


323
00:35:05,780 --> 00:35:07,780
Yay.


324
00:35:07,780 --> 00:35:21,780
If there is anything else, please find me or Huni and like let us know if there's an afterthought you have at any point.


325
00:35:21,780 --> 00:35:22,780
Thank you.


326
00:35:22,780 --> 00:35:37,780
Thank you very much.
