## List all the products, tools, and companies discussed

- Helia: a new implementation of IPFS in JavaScript, aiming to be more ergonomic, usable, and observable
- IPFS: InterPlanetary File System, a peer-to-peer hypermedia protocol
- libp2p: a modular network stack for creating decentralized peer-to-peer applications
- bitswap: a peer-to-peer data sharing protocol
- UnixFS: a file system used for storing and managing files in IPFS
- Node: a JavaScript runtime environment for running JavaScript code on the server side
- Browsers: Web browsers that can utilize IPFS (not specified which ones)
- Electron: a framework for creating cross-platform desktop apps with web technologies
- Deno: a secure runtime for JavaScript and TypeScript
- Protocol Labs: the company behind IPFS, libp2p, and other distributed technologies

## List all the weak signals of things an almighty AI could do to improve the presenter's life

- AI could automatically analyze and flag alignment issues in the various components of IPFS implementations, making it easier to identify and fix problems.
- AI could suggest potential optimizations in implementation details and features to improve performance in JavaScript environments.
- AI could predict integration issues with different bundlers and technologies, helping to address them proactively.

## List all the weak signals of things that are already great in the presenter's life

- The excitement around the development of Helia and the potential for better performance and usability through its new design.
- The existing reusable components shared with JSIPFS (libp2p, bitswap, UnixFS) that can help in building a more efficient implementation.
- The growing list of examples and integrations provided in the Helia repository, making it easier for users to adopt and work with the technology.
- Having a community and platform to present and share ideas (the Implementations Showcase).
