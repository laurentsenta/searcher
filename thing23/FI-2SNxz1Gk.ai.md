## Overview

In this video, Robin Berjon introduces the importance of having a set of core principles to maintain cohesion in the IPFS ecosystem. He then elaborates on the primary characteristics that make something IPFS-like, the positive outcomes resulting from it, and how these principles contribute to the robustness of the IPFS.

## Core Principles in IPFS

To maintain cohesion amidst the rapid growth of IPFS implementations, it's essential to have a core set of principles that all of IPFS can share. The core principles in IPFS are meant to be a living document, changing and evolving over time as our understanding improves.

The primary characteristics required to make something IPFS-like are:

1. Content-addressed with verifiability at the endpoints
2. Utilization of arbitrary transports

With these two basic characteristics, IPFS ensures self-certified addressability and robustness.

### Self-Certified Addressability

In the traditional web, authority is delegated to both DNS and servers, creating an asymmetry of power between users and server owners. By using content-identified addressing (CIDs) instead, self-certified addressability is achieved, allowing users to verify content without relying on third-party authorities.

### Robustness

Being strict about the outcomes at the endpoints while being completely tolerant in the middle allows for greater robustness, enabling experimentation and adaptability for various situations, devices, and network topologies.

## Conclusion

By focusing on these core principles and their positive outcomes, the IPFS ecosystem remains cohesive while fostering innovation, flexibility, and greater trust in addressing and verifying content.
