1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,520
So today I'm going to tell you all about Durin. I announced this back at IPFS camp,


2
00:00:08,520 --> 00:00:13,760
so we'll have some updates from then. We'll answer some questions about what it is, how


3
00:00:13,760 --> 00:00:19,800
it's built, what we have in the future, and mostly like the purposes of it. So to start


4
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:24,800
out here, what is Durin? Dietrich really summed it up really well in this tweet here. He said,


5
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:30,760
Durin is an iOS and Android app for exploring IPFS use cases, initially with read and share


6
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:36,560
flows but with a place where we can experiment with like-client protocol implementation,


7
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:43,960
proximity transports, and the where's my stuff problem. So yeah, Android app, iOS app, we


8
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:50,240
support the uploading and we support IPFS colon slash slash links with protocol handling.


9
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:53,920
We're going to go ahead and convert those to HTTPS for share. This is like really simple


10
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:59,800
stuff that we were doing already in like companion. We try and get your content as fast as possible


11
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:04,640
on mobile here. We use basically like a racing or caching gateway. I'll explain a little


12
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:08,920
bit more of that in like the next slide. And we're really thinking of this as like a base


13
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:14,880
for IPFS enabled apps, like a very, very like simple base for those. So we want people to,


14
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:18,760
we want to make this friendly enough, document it, put tutorials together so that people


15
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:24,360
can just fork this and start building off of it. And lastly, it's a testing ground for


16
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:30,000
just as any experimental things we can come up with to try new things on mobile. So how


17
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,720
does it work? I mentioned the racing or caching gateway. Simplest way to explain this is we


18
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:41,280
wanted to put the most lightweight way to access IPFS on mobile. As we know, like Kubo


19
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:46,880
is not really built with mobile in mind initially. We have some new stuff coming in from Iro


20
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:51,240
and things, which I'll actually kind of touch on later in the talk also, which might be


21
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:57,080
more efficient on battery and these things on mobile. So, but we weren't quite there


22
00:01:57,080 --> 00:02:02,640
yet. So we wanted to do the lowest resource intensive thing that we can do. And so we


23
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:09,240
came up with was we're, we get a list of gateways basically, and we check them on an interval.


24
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:14,320
We rank them based on the speed and the health of the gateways. As you can see over here


25
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:19,120
on the right side of the screen, this is a screenshot of the settings page. So if you


26
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:22,960
have auto selected there, that's the default, it's going to go ahead and rank these gateways


27
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:29,360
and try and return you the fastest one from the fastest gateway. But we have the option


28
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:32,960
if you're having issues or anything like that, or you just want to, you really like a gateway


29
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:38,800
specifically, you can just select that there. I want to mention there's an IPIP that was


30
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:44,960
work was a lot moving a lot faster in 2022. I'd like to pick up some of the momentum from


31
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:51,560
that. Mark Geiser was working on this. He was like heading it up mostly. And he's still


32
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:55,920
involved absolutely with it. But this is the multi-client gateway. This is the type of


33
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:59,960
work that's really going to help these like light client nodes. If we can really define


34
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:04,040
that and get everybody working together with that. So I have a link to it at the end of


35
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:09,200
the talk. So I encourage you if you're interested to take a look at that, give some input on


36
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:15,280
the pull request. I'd like to get that moving. Like we mentioned, we do that transformation


37
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:23,880
of the IPFS to HTTPS, really simple transformation there. Same as companion, the browser extension.


38
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:31,200
Our uploads are done up to web3.storage. They've been really easy to work with. And then the


39
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:38,960
sharing, obviously we have the built-in sharing that any like iOS or Android app has. This


40
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:43,080
is like airdrop messaging, all that built-in stuff. We just get that for free. We also


41
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:47,840
generate QR codes to make it really simple to pass files around. And then we are just


42
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:53,180
added share targets. So now if you're actually in like the photos app or accessing these


43
00:03:53,180 --> 00:03:56,800
photos like directly, you can open up the share button and Durin is actually one of


44
00:03:56,800 --> 00:04:02,400
those options to share to. And then it will auto upload and then you'll get your CID back,


45
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:08,240
share links, all those things. So what's new since IPFS camp? I just mentioned the share


46
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:13,120
target. This is a screenshot of it like sort of in action. You can see down at the bottom,


47
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:16,920
the Durin is one of the things you can share directly to. This is a photo from Robin's


48
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:23,480
talk yesterday. Should be shipping this week, next week. We're really close to it. We're


49
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:29,040
just working on some permissions issues with iOS. There's a new design. We cleaned up a


50
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:35,880
lot. Looking a little bit better for like a more mainstream release here. We got a couple


51
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:41,780
bug fixes, always adding more gateways. As more and more gateways show up on the public


52
00:04:41,780 --> 00:04:45,720
gateway checker and just through word of mouth when I hear about them, because not everything


53
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:50,840
is on there, we try and check and make sure that they have to have the subdomain support


54
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:55,240
and we like them to have the IP and S support so that it's just going to work the best with


55
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:59,840
us here and that we can support everything. So if you run a gateway, we'd love for you


56
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:03,600
to and you don't support the subdomain stuff, we'd love to talk to you and try and help


57
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:09,280
you get that moving along. Because the more the better, especially for people that are


58
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:15,400
in different regions. We also added a featured apps list. These are simple things, but they


59
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:21,640
can go a long way, I think. I'll talk a little bit more about the featured apps later.


60
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:27,560
So what's happening next? Like we mentioned the featured apps, I have IPFS search is one


61
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:35,480
of those. We're basically looking for what are IPFS enabled apps or things that run on


62
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:40,000
IPFS that look really good and have a good experience on mobile. We're going to feature


63
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:46,120
those and I think as we spend more time auditing these things and we get feedback of what people


64
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:49,600
like of these featured apps, we're looking at possibly doing integration with them. I


65
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:55,880
talked to the IPFS search in Portugal and that was really exciting. After playing with


66
00:05:55,880 --> 00:06:01,160
that on mobile, I was really impressed by how good the integration feels already, just


67
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:07,720
like linking to it. Talk about maybe doing some file encryption, file sharing of encrypted


68
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:13,920
files. After watching the Delta chat talk, obviously got me thinking about the Iro integration


69
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:19,040
stuff. I have that PR open in another browser tab right now, hoping to get time to dig into


70
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:26,920
that through the hack days. Talking about contacts API support, maybe with wallet integrations.


71
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:31,960
There's still probably too early to do a talk on that, but if you're interested, I'd love


72
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:36,360
to chat with you about it. We have some pretty interesting ideas there. And then we were


73
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:41,840
talking about photo backups possibly using FVM and Filecoin. I think we could probably


74
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:47,420
do some interesting stuff there, probably also offer very competitive pricing to existing


75
00:06:47,420 --> 00:06:53,360
cloud stuff. So what's for sure happening, that was the exploration share target. Want


76
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:58,320
to make it so people can use the web3.storage key directly so they can have all their stuff


77
00:06:58,320 --> 00:07:03,000
in one place. Right now we have a global key just to make it as easy as possible. I also


78
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:09,360
want to talk with the web3.storage team and see if we can get specific flows for getting


79
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:15,680
your own API key for less technical users. Always trying to add those new gateways. Think


80
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:22,520
about adding this into the FDroid store. We want to do a tutorial on forking the project.


81
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:25,720
Like we mentioned before, we want this to be a really, really easy base for people to


82
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:31,800
get started with IPFS on mobile in a very, very lightweight way. No crazy battery usage


83
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:35,600
or anything like that. But that's on us. We've got to document it. We've got to make it so


84
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:40,960
it's really easy to do. We have a blog post. We're finally going to announce this in a


85
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:46,640
wider way on the IPFS blog. So keep an eye out for that probably in the next week or


86
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:51,160
so. And I'd like to add a little bit more metrics. We get a couple built in things,


87
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:55,520
but would like to get a little bit more information there.


88
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:58,640
So how do you get it? It's in the Google Play store. It's in the App Store. I'll be sharing


89
00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:02,680
that repo too if you feel like pulling it down, building it, giving us some feedback


90
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:08,360
that way too. And how do you contribute? So I've added this QR code. It's actually like


91
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:12,480
a big link list, like link in bio thing, you know, like you'd see on Instagram or whatever.


92
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:17,160
A lot of stuff on there. I want to say before I get into all the contributions, big shout


93
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:20,760
out to Trigram. They've been working with us for a while on this. They're a contracting


94
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:26,240
company. They build a lot of products of their own and stuff also. So they've done like wonderful,


95
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:29,560
wonderful work with this and we're looking to continue working with them.


96
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:34,080
How can you contribute? More gateways with subdomain support. If you look at that public


97
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:40,240
gateway checker, not that many actually have like the subdomain support. I want to keep


98
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:47,800
seeing how we can build that up. Check out that, the IPIP that we were talking about,


99
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:52,400
the multi gateways IPIP. There's a couple other IPIPs that link to that also. I got


100
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:58,520
the GitHub repo right there. IPFS shipyard. We're always in browsers and platforms on


101
00:08:58,520 --> 00:09:05,760
Slack. Any ideas you got, any, you know, bugs you see, come talk to me there about it. Fork


102
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:11,680
it. Try building it. Build your own IPFS app. Submit ideas. Hack with us this week.


103
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:18,760
Lastly, if you have a mobile or IPFS project, we definitely need to talk. I want to get


104
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:21,840
as much input as possible. I want to help other people with this. I think we should


105
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:25,320
all sync up. And that's all I have today. Thank you.


106
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:30,840
Super interesting. While you were talking, I downloaded the app and tried using it. So,


107
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:36,200
one thing I noticed was it's very gateway centric. Are you thinking down the road map


108
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:43,680
to do IPFS over other protocols like Bluetooth, LED, things like that? Maybe an Android, whatever


109
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:49,920
the Android version of AirDrop is for more like peer to peer local networks?


110
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:54,400
Totally. Yeah. That's something we've talked about. So, you can use AirDrop right now,


111
00:09:54,400 --> 00:10:00,440
but it's not within Duran. One of the things we talked about was having AirDrop, but then


112
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:04,960
when you receive it on the other end, actually trying to verify the CIDs. It's one of the


113
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:12,080
things we talked about. We've also we looked into having local connectivity with MDNS.


114
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:16,560
We actually had a version of that working, but you had to change some of the default


115
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:23,280
configs in Kubo nodes. And it was something that was like really not secure enough, we


116
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:27,720
would say, that we would want to recommend to people. So, there's still work to be done


117
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:31,560
there. There's still exploration. We were getting like it was operating super fast.


118
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:36,080
And it was really cool being able to see stuff directly from your node or the gateways and


119
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:39,640
like racing them against each other. So, that's definitely a priority. Something I really


120
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:45,600
want to see happen. Need to get a little bit more in touch with the Kubo team and see where


121
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:50,760
that's moving along. I don't know that it's like the highest priority right now for them.


122
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:54,920
They have a lot of stuff on their plate, but definitely something I want to check out.


123
00:10:54,920 --> 00:11:02,440
Hey, so I work at the Falcon Foundation with the decentralized web kind of gang of folks.


124
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:09,240
And there's a lot of them building or wanting to build tools for archiving and verification


125
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:13,560
on mobile. And I was just wondering if you were chatting to like the Guardian project


126
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:20,560
people already. Good. You sort of looked a little like, oh, I don't think I am. Because


127
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:27,040
they also do FDroid. They also actually help run the FDroid. And they're the people working


128
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:35,160
on FDroid on IPFS. So, they're sort of super deep in it. And now I will... Your expression


129
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:37,360
has answered the question. So, I'll introduce you.


130
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:43,600
So, yeah. Would love to chat with them. That sounds sick. And I will say, too, we love


131
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:47,860
archiving stuff. So, we have another project we did, Pintweet IPFS, where we're working


132
00:11:47,860 --> 00:11:52,780
with WebRecorder to get all that stuff archived. And obviously, this is such an experimental


133
00:11:52,780 --> 00:11:57,640
open app that can be forged and all these things. So, I mean, maybe one day we'll make


134
00:11:57,640 --> 00:12:01,720
one that's specifically for archiving things. And not just like photos and sharing like


135
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:03,760
that. So...


136
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:10,320
So great progress on the team since IPFS camp. This is amazing. Are there any plans to...


137
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:16,760
Like on Android, you can register an app as a system-wide VPN. So, can we register this


138
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:24,080
as a VPN and say... Can we start resolving IPFS content dynamically like Companion does


139
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:25,080
in the browser?


140
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:29,880
That would be sick. Yeah. I hadn't even thought about that. So, let's talk about it. Yeah.


141
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:30,880
I like that a lot.


142
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:33,960
Okay. Okay. We'll talk. Okay. Thanks.


143
00:12:33,960 --> 00:13:00,960
Thank you.
