## List all the products, tools, and companies discussed

- DHT double hashing: a proposed reader privacy upgrade improving content lookup privacy in the IPFS protocol's Distributed Hash Table
- IPFS: the InterPlanetary File System, a protocol and peer-to-peer network for storing and sharing data in a distributed file system
- IPNS: the InterPlanetary Naming System, an experimental protocol built on top of IPFS that creates mutable pointers to data, allowing for versioned content addressing
- Kubo: a Kubo release would include the new DHT code and orchestrate node migration to the new version

## List all the weak signals of things an almighty AI could do to improve the presenter's life

- Migration strategy: help in defining the optimal timeline and parameters for the migration plan, such as the transition period, IPNS key fetching frequency, and determining when a sufficient number of peers have upgraded
- Threat model communication: assist in clearly illustrating the threat models and how the new DHT double hashing approach affects them
- Testing: contribute towards the development of a comprehensive test plan to ensure the proposed DHT double hashing changes work as expected in production before a full rollout

## List all the weak signals of things that are already great in the presenter's life

- IPFS protocol: providing a highly flexible and efficient distributed file system for a wide range of purposes
- DHT double hashing approach: the proposed privacy upgrade addresses concerns of reader privacy in the existing IPFS protocol
- Collaboration within the IPFS community: the development of the DHT double hashing approach has involved a great amount of collaboration and contribution from experts in the IPFS ecosystem
