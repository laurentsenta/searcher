1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,760
Hello everyone, I'm Bastien, I'm working as a Program Manager at Fission and today I'm


2
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:12,320
going to talk to you about StarMaps.


3
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:16,980
So it's a roadmapping tool developed by our protocol labs.


4
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:22,240
So first I'd like to talk about the benefits of having a roadmap for your project.


5
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:27,380
So of course it's going to help you clarify your goals and objectives for your project


6
00:00:27,380 --> 00:00:33,040
and it's kind of important because most of the time the people in production really don't


7
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:41,520
like the high-level vision of the project because they're so focused on their work.


8
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:47,980
And so it's going to help you communicate your objectives and collaborate inside the


9
00:00:47,980 --> 00:00:54,040
team because you're going to engage your developers more and obviously you're going to increase


10
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:58,360
your visibility towards external audience.


11
00:00:58,360 --> 00:01:02,520
And since we are in a network we have a lot of interdependency with each other so it's


12
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:07,400
very important in my opinion to have a roadmap to communicate where you are currently in


13
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:09,560
your project.


14
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:17,420
And so doing this work of roadmapping your project is going to force you to set timelines


15
00:01:17,420 --> 00:01:21,300
by estimating your work from low level to high level.


16
00:01:21,300 --> 00:01:27,640
You're going to define your milestones more precisely because you're going to decide how


17
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:32,920
the quantity of work that you're going to put in there, the features and your objectives


18
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:35,120
for each of these.


19
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:39,460
And we also have to look at the dependencies that you have with other projects.


20
00:01:39,460 --> 00:01:47,440
So again doing so will allow you to have much more information when you're looking at your


21
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:48,780
project.


22
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:54,520
So that's going to help you to make better decisions when you will need to change the


23
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:59,240
way you're, like the direction you're going if you have to at some point.


24
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:06,080
And you're going to be able to identify roadblocks much earlier into the process of working on


25
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:07,720
your projects.


26
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:12,200
So that's going to save you time and resources for sure.


27
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:14,940
So yeah, so now you must really want to have a roadmap.


28
00:02:14,940 --> 00:02:17,640
Let's look at StarMap.


29
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:24,920
So it was developed and still being developed by Protocol Labs with the specific needs of


30
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:26,320
the network in mind.


31
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:34,480
It's a very flexible tool that can be used to render all kinds of roadmap because we


32
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:39,760
in the network we have so many different team sizes and the kind of projects we have people


33
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:41,100
that are still doing research.


34
00:02:41,100 --> 00:02:45,600
We have people that are in very different production cycles.


35
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:48,260
And it all renders from GitHub issues.


36
00:02:48,260 --> 00:02:53,080
So that's very handy because you don't have to duplicate your tasks to just put them in


37
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:56,900
a roadmap outside of the GitHub cycle.


38
00:02:56,900 --> 00:03:03,880
So with that said, I'm just going to show what we have currently at Fission in terms


39
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:04,880
of roadmap.


40
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:09,360
So this is the roadmap for the project at Fission.


41
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:16,080
So for now we have three, but we are currently working to adding more of these.


42
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:19,440
So this is the standard view for StarMaps.


43
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:21,160
You have a timeline.


44
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:26,880
You can see all of the project issues are displayed on the timeline based on their ETA,


45
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:33,200
which you can see at the bottom left of each card.


46
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:37,480
I'm going to just click on the IPVM project issue to show you what's inside.


47
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:44,920
So we have all of the milestones for IPVM here for Q1 2033 to future developments.


48
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:49,160
If I click on the right here on the date, you can see where we are currently.


49
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:55,640
So that gives you a nice view of where we are currently on the project.


50
00:03:55,640 --> 00:04:00,680
We have three view modes in StarMaps.


51
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:04,680
Currently we are using the overview one, but if we go in the detailed view, it's going


52
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:11,440
to display all of the child issues for each of these milestones in the StarMap.


53
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:12,800
So there you are.


54
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:17,480
So here you have the first milestone and all of the low-level issues that are inside.


55
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:21,760
If I scroll down, you can see the same for all of the other ones.


56
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:28,720
You can note that some tasks have a progress bar, but when they are completed, they are


57
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:29,920
filled in green.


58
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:37,320
And that's reflected as well in the milestones.


59
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:40,480
You can see here this one is partially filled.


60
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:47,640
Well, we are not quite there yet, but it's because we closed the first one in advance.


61
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:53,840
But yeah, so if I click into this milestone, you can see basically what we just saw in


62
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:55,720
the detailed view.


63
00:04:55,720 --> 00:05:00,800
And these issues are all stacked on top of each other because they all share the same


64
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:05,480
ETA, which is the same as the milestone they are in, but you can customize it if you want,


65
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:12,120
if you'd like to order your task in a specific way you want to work on them.


66
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:16,200
And yeah, so that's for the basic view of StarMaps.


67
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:22,960
If I go back to my Fission project node, so here I can view the issue in GitHub.


68
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:28,560
So I'm going to show you how it is formatted inside GitHub.


69
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:34,240
Right, so for the Fission project GitHub issue, so this is a container.


70
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:39,120
It doesn't have any work to be done.


71
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:43,960
This is really made to contain all of the projects that we have at Fission, and the


72
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:45,800
same goes for the milestone issues.


73
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:54,440
So all you need to do to have your issues rendered in StarMap is to add a children list.


74
00:05:54,440 --> 00:06:01,320
So basically a blood point list with the URLs of your issues to be done, and an ETA, and


75
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:02,320
that's it.


76
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:11,320
So if I click here on the IPVM project issue, we're going to see the milestones, right?


77
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:15,920
So the children of the project are the milestones.


78
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:16,920
Again we have an ETA here.


79
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:22,040
I've added some resources for people who are consulting the project to find.


80
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:26,920
And if I go again lower one level, right, so we have the objectives, the features that


81
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:32,840
we want to bring with this milestone, so that, you know, an effort of communication towards


82
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:37,040
the people who are interested in the project and want to learn more about it.


83
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:41,160
Again we have the ETA, and here we have all of the children that need to be done to complete


84
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:42,720
the milestone.


85
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:47,380
So StarMap supports a GitHub task list, so that's actually pretty handy because when


86
00:06:47,380 --> 00:06:55,240
all of your GitHub issues share the same ETA, we can just reorder them with a drag and drop,


87
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:57,320
and it's going to be reflected in StarMap as well.


88
00:06:57,320 --> 00:06:59,420
So I just lowered the metering.


89
00:06:59,420 --> 00:07:02,360
If I refresh StarMap, it's going to be lowered as well in the list.


90
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:06,840
So you can prioritize your tasks this way pretty easily.


91
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:13,720
And yeah, it's very easy to add dependencies because, again, you just have to grab the


92
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:20,160
URL of a GitHub issue and add it in the description, like here in this list, to show the dependency.


93
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:26,280
So if I'm waiting for a tech to be released from another team, you know, complete other


94
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:33,080
projects, I can just grab the URL of their tasks on myself, and I can just put it in


95
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:39,000
here, and I can create as many levels of deepness as I want.


96
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:44,240
Like currently at Vision, we are only using project, milestone, and GitHub issues for


97
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:45,280
lower level.


98
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:50,840
But if I want to use epics, user stories, any kind of container, I can.


99
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:56,640
I can just create a new GitHub issue, label it the way I want, and I just throw URLs in


100
00:07:56,640 --> 00:07:59,520
there, and I'm good.


101
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:05,920
So just to show you a bit what you can do with that, so let's say we have the Protocol


102
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:10,920
Labs network as a root node that's going to encapsulate all of the Protocol Labs network


103
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:12,560
projects.


104
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:15,240
So we have company one that has two projects.


105
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:17,720
Project A is working with epics and user stories.


106
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:23,200
Each user story has several issues, and project B is only using milestones and GitHub issues.


107
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:25,600
It really depends on the way you want to organize yourself.


108
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:31,200
But you can create dependencies any way you want to, from milestone to epic, from epics


109
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:34,200
to milestone, issue to issue.


110
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:40,520
And you can do the same with completely other projects from other repos.


111
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:48,960
Just to separate and avoid to put noise in repos, I've created a specific repo for the


112
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:53,200
Vision star map for all tasks that are used as containers.


113
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:57,480
So here we have the project issues and milestone issues.


114
00:08:57,480 --> 00:09:04,760
Right now we have 26 issues open, so we put them in there to avoid polluting the other


115
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:05,760
repos.


116
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:10,920
And yeah, that's pretty much it for the star map tour.


117
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:17,160
Now if you're interested in building your own star map, you can go to starmap.site.


118
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:22,600
They have a guide over there and templates for you to use for your star map.


119
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:31,680
There's also repos for the star map software, and we have our own repo for star map at Vision.


120
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:34,200
So feel free to look at these for reference.


121
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:39,600
If you need any help, don't hesitate to poke the team working on this on the file on Slack.


122
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:41,080
They have a channel for this.


123
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:42,080
They are very helpful.


124
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:45,760
They'll be happy to help you with any issue you may have.


125
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:51,720
And I will as well, so you can find me on Slack or the Vision Discord if you need any


126
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:52,720
help.


127
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:58,160
And so the QR code is for the Protocol Labs Network star map that I created, hoping that


128
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:02,000
someday we'll have many, many projects from the network in there.


129
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:08,600
Just to show you how it's looking right now, we have two companies' projects in there,


130
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:12,160
so maybe someday dozens of these.


131
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:13,800
I hope you'll as well.


132
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:16,880
Okay, that's it for star maps.


133
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:17,880
Thank you.


134
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:22,040
Any questions?


135
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:25,480
Hi.


136
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:33,400
Thanks for showing star map.


137
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:36,680
That's something I help maintain.


138
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:45,760
I'm really interested what features you are looking in, what features you would like to


139
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:50,200
see added the most first, like additional features or support.


140
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:52,840
I know there's some issues we need to address.


141
00:10:52,840 --> 00:11:00,080
I've been struggling with ETAs because I figured that we don't necessarily need an ETA for


142
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:06,800
every issue because sometimes you have containers that don't need an ETA and you will still


143
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:08,120
have to put one in there.


144
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:16,000
So the issue is how you will render it in the timeline if it doesn't have an ETA.


145
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:20,840
But yes, sometimes you just want to put placeholders somewhere, but it's going to give you an error


146
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:22,920
instead.


147
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:25,880
So yeah, there's that.


148
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:37,400
But I had a whole bunch of features that I wanted to request regarding star map, but


149
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:40,880
I can definitely talk to you about it.


150
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:54,040
But we can chat about it right after.


151
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:57,360
I'm curious what you're finding this the most useful for.


152
00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:04,080
What are maybe the three things that you do with your star maps on a weekly or monthly


153
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:10,200
basis, and whether it's mostly within team or with stakeholders or with other groups


154
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:12,840
that you're using it?


155
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:16,200
Because I feel like it's a new useful tool.


156
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:20,560
It was created because we couldn't find anything else open source that did the things that


157
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:22,280
we felt like we needed.


158
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:30,080
But I think we'd love to see it have a wider community of maintainers and filling that


159
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:35,120
niche for other groups that want an open source planning tool, not having to put everything


160
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:39,200
inside of some silo that only works within their organization.


161
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:44,800
I'm curious, what are the common use cases that we can then maybe share with others and


162
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:48,040
build up more of an open source community around maintaining this?


163
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:54,880
Right now we've been mostly using it internally to communicate how we are doing on our projects,


164
00:12:54,880 --> 00:13:01,640
especially IPVM, but also new ones like GoCamera that we've been recently planning.


165
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:04,000
So it's been very useful in that regard.


166
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:08,760
But also when you have dependencies with other teams, it's very easy to send them just the


167
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:14,560
link of your star map and then they can see, okay, so you need this from me.


168
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:15,560
That's cool.


169
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:18,960
I'm going to focus on that and help you there.


170
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:23,840
So that's most of our uses with that at the moment.


171
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:24,840
Makes total sense.


172
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:25,920
I will also answer it.


173
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:29,440
So Bastien is our first technical program manager at Vision.


174
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:34,240
And I said, you need to be an ecosystem level TPM.


175
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:35,720
Star Maps is brand new.


176
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:39,120
We're going to help evangelize it because we think it's going to help us long term.


177
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:42,320
We need to do roadmaps in some format.


178
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:43,640
Let's do it this way.


179
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:50,280
We've noticed that there are some teams who are putting protocols that we work on in their


180
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:53,240
backlogs, not yet star map enabled.


181
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:57,640
And so the next thing we'd like is generally more community evangelism and bootstrapping


182
00:13:57,640 --> 00:13:59,840
of using it by default.


183
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:03,280
And then we're trying to leave, we're like, what is the right method of like, I'm like,


184
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:09,720
okay, Bastien, I saw WinFS mentioned on this slide, go track down the team and figure out


185
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:14,880
if they've committed engineering resources to doing it so that we can put it on the overall


186
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:15,880
map.


187
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:20,880
So I think we're in this boot up phase where I'd really like us all to just do that.


188
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:25,440
And then ideally it's a very useful tool where we can then work back and be like, oh, there's


189
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:28,920
three teams pointing at needing to do X.


190
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:34,760
Oh, that could be a small library or something else that like all three teams work on together.


191
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:37,720
So that's our like, hopes start network wide.


192
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:39,120
Like, and it's a super useful tool.


193
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:40,120
Right.


194
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:43,420
I think like we've, we've found more like there isn't anything else like this.


195
00:14:43,420 --> 00:14:44,560
We run a bunch of orgs.


196
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:46,200
We're not in just one GitHub org.


197
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:50,840
So it solves problems for us already, which is a really great starting point.


198
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:53,520
So thank you for, thank you for building it.


199
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:54,520
Yeah.


200
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:56,880
I have my own whole list of feature requests.


201
00:14:56,880 --> 00:15:01,520
I feel like we should start tracking them somewhere so that whoever feels strongly about


202
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:05,320
them can a help prioritize, be help solve.


203
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:10,540
But as someone who uses it across many different teams in many different orgs and you want


204
00:15:10,540 --> 00:15:15,480
every group to be responsible for their own milestones, but then you want them all to


205
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:19,800
roll up into one view where you can then take a screenshot of it and like present it of


206
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:22,240
like, Hey, this is what everyone is doing.


207
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:24,080
That's what I found it most useful for personally.


208
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:28,040
It might be a really interesting starting point for even like turning the crank even


209
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:29,440
more of about a few other things.


210
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:34,360
Like, you know, do we create an open collective for star maps?


211
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:35,600
I'm like, great.


212
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:38,140
I'll throw 500 bucks a month into it.


213
00:15:38,140 --> 00:15:45,680
And then we can fund independence doing a backlog of tasks along it or something like


214
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:46,680
that.


215
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:47,680
Right.


216
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:48,680
I love that.


217
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:52,720
I think that would take part of those 500 bucks and are random humans who would just


218
00:15:52,720 --> 00:16:00,080
start building stuff.


219
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:03,760
I'm curious because I would assume some people might ask this question.


220
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:07,960
Like how did you find using star maps compared to some of GitHub's more recent roadmapping


221
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:11,960
projects, roadmapping tools?


222
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:14,120
I think they don't have the same use case.


223
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:19,200
Like it, and projects is really more to track your issues on a daily basis.


224
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:23,760
You, the milestones don't work the same way as well.


225
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:28,880
It's also, it's not made to reflect several projects at a time.


226
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:36,200
I mean, you can do that, but it's not optimal, at least not from a roadmap perspective.


227
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:42,960
I feel like it's much easier to flag dependencies using, using star maps in general.


228
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:49,840
And it also makes more sense in the, in the, in the, like the general layout of the tool.


229
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:51,880
So yeah.


230
00:16:51,880 --> 00:17:00,360
And in a way you can also create so many different layers for your roadmap.


231
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:04,880
Like I mentioned, you can create any kind of container and you can't really do that


232
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:07,320
in, in the GitHub projects.


233
00:17:07,320 --> 00:17:09,920
Like you really have to walk in a waterfall.


234
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:10,920
It's like a Kanban.


235
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:16,160
It's a, it's like a Trello, but in, but in GitHub, whereas here you are really creating,


236
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:21,640
you can create a peaks and user stories and really child issues if you, as much as you


237
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:22,640
want.


238
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:26,520
So it's not really the same use case in my opinion.


239
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:31,440
So I think it makes more sense to use a star map for, for roadmaps.


240
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:32,440
Yeah.


241
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:33,440
Cool.


242
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:34,440
Thanks.


243
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:35,440
Maybe just one quick follow up.


244
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:36,880
Maybe this is Molly and Boris.


245
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:40,840
Like what is the, how do we get going on something like an open collective to drive some more


246
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:43,200
I'm not familiar with how we, how we do that.


247
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:48,200
We haven't done it before, but you're in literally the right track for it.


248
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:51,680
Join the working group, working group.


249
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:55,160
I'll put it in the hack MD.


250
00:17:55,160 --> 00:18:00,840
And I think even star mats itself being a tool that working groups are familiar with,


251
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:01,840
right?


252
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:04,400
Like it's another, a kit of tools, right?


253
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:05,560
Yeah.


254
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:09,360
I mean, we should have stomped for specs.


255
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:10,360
Right.


256
00:18:10,360 --> 00:18:13,840
You want to say, Oh, I think Steve just asked it.


257
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:18,360
It was like, yeah, for a team that's coming at it from a cold start, what resources do


258
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:19,360
we have?


259
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:24,920
And do you need a Guinea pig to help document the process?


260
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:25,920
Yeah.


261
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:30,760
Well, you have the whole guide on star map that site that explains everything, like how


262
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:32,640
to read your star map from, from scratch.


263
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:37,880
All you need to do is do the road mapping process for yourself.


264
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:43,040
So you, you look at, you look at your spec, you look at the features you want to produce


265
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:47,120
in which order you, how you, you set your timelines and you, you create your GitHub


266
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:48,360
issues based on, based on that.


267
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:51,520
And you just have to format them to be rendered in there.


268
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:59,040
And after that, once you have your root node for your star map, which is basically like


269
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:04,600
the content container for all of your projects in your team, you just copy and paste the


270
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:12,360
URL, sorry, the URL in star maps, and it's going to be rendered automatically from there.


271
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:13,840
The site is like no BS.


272
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:16,480
It starts straight into like the docs of how to get started.


273
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:18,560
So that's like.


274
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:26,560
I have a, just given that we are in the community governance track, I'm curious what we think


275
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:35,160
about creating like project level star maps or things that aggregate over top of various


276
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:42,880
different working groups or highlight major like milestones for the IPFS project as a


277
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:48,080
whole, which then, you know, should be looking across the fission star maps and the IP steward


278
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:54,440
star maps and the IRO star maps if they have one and the content routing privacy working


279
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:59,840
group star maps and, you know, each one of those has their own star map, ideally, which,


280
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:24,840
you know.


281
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:30,000
focus is on the contributions that are being made by that group, but then having something at a broader level that's able to surface the top level, most important milestones that everyone can celebrate. I remember from my days doing project leadership stuff in IPFS that there's always that yearly request of like, what are the like 10 most important things that are happening this year that I should really be excited about and maybe help work on? And so I'm curious if there's interest, challenges,


282
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:34,200
like, you know, what would need to be true in order to make that possible?


283
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:43,280
I think one huge part of it ends up being how much of is a roadmap that has committed


284
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:49,260
engineering resources? How do we surface? We would, how do we surface a signal that


285
00:20:49,260 --> 00:20:56,700
says we would really like X, we absolutely can't build it. And that might be technical


286
00:20:56,700 --> 00:21:03,540
skill, engineering bandwidth, or funding. So there's a couple of other things that currently


287
00:21:03,540 --> 00:21:09,640
isn't really mapped in here, but somewhere along the way we could use similar techniques,


288
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:20,020
right? So as an example, GitHub repos have a funding.yaml. And so that would actually


289
00:21:20,020 --> 00:21:27,340
surface if a particular code repo had an attached way to pay it already. And that could be everything


290
00:21:27,340 --> 00:21:34,300
from an open collective to a Patreon to a Filecoin address. So those might be some other


291
00:21:34,300 --> 00:21:40,420
things. I think I'd love to see, like, I think the missing thing here actually is the hopes,


292
00:21:40,420 --> 00:21:46,140
wishes, and dreams that are like a superset of engineering resources, right? Like what


293
00:21:46,140 --> 00:21:53,140
happens before you write the roadmap almost? Maybe?


294
00:21:53,140 --> 00:21:59,060
Yeah I think also surfacing visibility to people who don't have IPFS as their day job


295
00:21:59,060 --> 00:22:04,940
but are interested. I know, like, I remember being on the other side of that was like,


296
00:22:04,940 --> 00:22:08,860
hey, this is super interesting what's going on and feels like you're opening a cupboard


297
00:22:08,860 --> 00:22:14,740
and like the entire universe is falling on you. And so having a way of summarizing things


298
00:22:14,740 --> 00:22:19,940
at a high level for a broader community of interested people I think is something that


299
00:22:19,940 --> 00:22:26,380
would be extremely valuable.


300
00:22:26,380 --> 00:22:32,620
I think all of that feeds really neatly into the opening conversation that you two kicked


301
00:22:32,620 --> 00:22:38,220
off this morning. And a lot of those questions would be answered really neatly by a meta


302
00:22:38,220 --> 00:22:44,500
working group for the IPFS project.


303
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:46,500
We should have done that on the slide.


304
00:22:46,500 --> 00:23:15,500
All right. Thank you.
