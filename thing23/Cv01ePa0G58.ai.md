## Overview

In this video, Jorropo, a Protocol Labs developer, introduces their work on RAPIDE. They demonstrate how RAPIDE works and discuss its features. RAPIDE is a content distribution algorithm that allows users to download files from multiple nodes simultaneously, making downloads much faster than traditional methods.

## Content

Jorropo, who also goes by Hugo, works on the IP Stewards team at Protocol Labs. They begin by discussing the IPFS library Kubo and its derivative, Boxo, which helps users build applications using Kubo primitives. Then, they introduce RAPIDE, which is a project that they have been working on.

Jorropo notes that while Torrent is a peer-to-peer (P2P) network, it remains one of the fastest ways to download files on the Internet. The reason for this is that it takes many different computers, and they all provide content so you can download simultaneously from many people at once. Jorropo calls this negative one scaling, as the more people you have, the faster your download goes. Jorropo wondered if this could be achieved with IPFS. They demonstrated that the IPFS website, ipfs.io, has 42 people hosting it. However, when they attempted to download it, it was quite slow. 

Jorropo then demonstrated R
