## List all the products, tools, and companies discussed

- Cryptosat: the presenter's company that builds and launches satellites into low Earth orbits for Web3 use cases, cryptographic protocols, and confidential computing
- KCG: the centralized ceremony related to Ethereum scaling that requires parties to produce public parameters that can be trusted later on to be produced with computational integrity in a certain way, which Cryptosat contributed to from their second satellite in space
- Baka.io: a project within Protocol Labs that is an example of decentralized cloud compute
- Super Protocol: a project that is another example of decentralized cloud compute
- Cache: a marketplace that is more of an example of decentralized cloud compute
- TauByte: a serverless decentralized compute project mentioned by the presenter
- SGX: a feature in some CPUs that provides a trusted execution environment

## List all the weak signals of things that are already great in the presenter's life

- Cryptosat has successfully launched two satellites and performed experiments aboard the International Space Station to test different aspects of operations with the assets in space.
- Cryptosat has participated in the KCG ceremony related to Ethereum scaling and contributed to it from their second satellite in space.
- Cryptosat is working on launching more satellites to work towards their constellation.
- Cryptosat provides a trusted execution environment that is completely physically isolated, lacks any physical access, and cannot compromise anything in memory, use any side channels, and so on. 
- Cryptosat already serves some customers with use cases that require trusted setups for cryptographic schemes, such as producing a trusted setup for a ZK-SNARK scheme that's used by the DoraHax DAO that serves for community project funding.
- Cryptosat has a tracking website that shows the locations of their two satellites in space and a CryptoSat simulator, which is mostly for onboarding and explaining the different use cases that they're addressing.
