Hi everyone! I'm Yuni Graham, and I'm here with Niki Gokani to share some exciting news about IPFS Camp 2023. The event will be held in Bangalore, India, from November 3rd to 5th, and we can't wait for all of you to join us there.

We chose India as the location for IPFS Camp 2023 for several reasons, as Nikki will explain. According to GitHub, India has a growing developer community, with 2.5 million out of 20 million new developers in 2022 coming from that country. India is projected to have 10 million developers by 2025, and it is expected that the highest number of web 3.0 developers globally will be in India in the next one to two years.

India also has a large population of 1.4 billion people, and 60% of them own smartphones, providing a huge audience for scaling IPFS and distributed web. Our experience at India Blockchain Week in 2022 was amazing, and we saw first-hand the enthusiasm and skills of the developer community in India.

We're excited to work with our community in India to build initiatives leading up to IPFS Camp, and Nikki invites anyone interested to find her and talk about getting involved.
