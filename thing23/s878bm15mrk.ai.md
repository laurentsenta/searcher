Robin begins by discussing the technocratic movement in the early 20th century, highlighting its goals and the impact it had on the organization of society. He establishes a connection between the technocratic society and the current internet/web ecosystem we live with today.

He also emphasizes the importance of having a clear understanding of the nature and objectives of the web, especially when addressing the challenge of maintaining user agency in an environment dominated by monopolies and centralized control.

Robin dives into the topic of what constitutes the web, discussing the difficulty in defining the web due to its constantly evolving technologies. He proposes a definition: "The web is the set of network technologies that work to increase user agency."

Taking inspiration from the capabilities approach in political philosophy, Robin outlines a few high-level ideas for reshaping the web for increased user agency. Some of these ideas include turning search and social into protocols, building apps more like the web itself, creating protocols for advertising, and developing personalized synthetic intelligence systems.

Despite the technical and political challenges in reshaping the web, Robin is hopeful for the future, citing the advancements in cooperative computing, governance innovation, and the potential of IPFS.

## Key Takeaways
