## Overview

In this video, Ryan Plauche introduces the development of MySelli, the new IPFS (InterPlanetary File System) implementation that aims to bring IPFS to space. He highlights the challenges faced in adapting IPFS for space applications and discusses the current progress and goals of the project.

Hello, my name is Ryan Plauche, and I work with Little Bear Labs. Today, I'm going to attempt to answer the question, "Are we interplanetary yet?" which is about the effort to put IPFS in space.

I want to introduce MySelli, which is the new IPFS implementation for deploying IPFS into space. Currently, we do not have any cool logo for it, so if anyone wants to contribute a logo of fungus in space, that would be great.

IPFS in space cannot be the same as your cloud server's IPFS. We need a different approach to work with satellites' unreliable connections and hardware constraints. Our initial goal is to make content-addressable data transmittable across a radio link from a satellite to a ground station.

To actually become interplanetary, there's a plan for a demonstration mission later this year. This mission aims to transmit data from a single satellite to a single ground station and finally to the broader public IPFS network.

I will give a talk on Monday in the integrating IPFS track to share more details about the project and show a live demo.

We invite anyone interested in this project to check out the code, see how it works, or give it a try. Visit the space repo in the IPFS shipyard organization and the space channel on the Falcoin Slack.

## Key Takeaways

- MySelli is a new IPFS implementation for deploying IPFS into space.
- There are challenges with adapting IPFS for space applications, such as hardware constraints and connectivity issues.
- A demonstration mission is planned for later this year to showcase the progress made so far.
