Hi everyone! I see a lot of faces from last year, a lot of new faces, some faces from


2
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:18,960
IPFS Camp 2022, but we're here to announce the dates and the location for IPFS Camp 2023,


3
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:29,560
which is going to be November 3rd through the 5th in Bangalore, India.


4
00:00:29,560 --> 00:00:34,960
We're super excited, and if you take a photo of this QR code, it'll link you to our pre-registration


5
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:39,960
page along with some other links in there. So go ahead and pre-register to stay up to


6
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:46,560
date on all the news and updates. Yay! Super exciting! Nikki's going to talk a bit more


7
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:47,560
about India.


8
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:55,280
Hi everyone, I'm Nikki, I lead the Hackathons program at Protocol Labs, and also coordinate


9
00:00:55,280 --> 00:01:00,800
India-related initiatives. I just wanted to give you a little bit of a background on why


10
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:09,000
India for IPFS Camp. So according to GitHub, 2.5 million out of the 20 million new developers


11
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:19,560
they got in 2022, 2.5 million are from India. And by 2025, 10 million devs would be from


12
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:28,200
India. And in one to two years, the highest number of web 3.0 devs globally would be from


13
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:35,280
here. It's a country with 1.4 billion in population, and 60% of them own a smartphone, so that's


14
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:47,400
like a huge audience that is available to scale IPFS and distributed web.


15
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:55,240
We also had an amazing experience last year at India Blockchain Week in 2022. We did Phil


16
00:01:55,240 --> 00:02:01,200
Bangalore, which had 1,300 attendees. We have a very strong community, Hudlo1, which is


17
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:06,720
a PL network company built on top of Lippie2P and Filecoin. They organized Phil Bangalore


18
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:14,520
for us, 1,300 attendees, all of them really strong developers. And we also were a big


19
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:21,360
part of ETH India, which is a hackathon by ETH Global. And the India hackathon was the


20
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:27,240
biggest hackathon they had done till date, with 1,750 hackers, 2,100 total attendees,


21
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:33,960
and 450 projects were built in those two days. So yeah, we got great energy, and India is


22
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:41,000
like full of developers who want to solve really hard problems in networking. And yeah,


23
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:45,440
I look forward to doing a few initiatives with all of you before we do IPFS camp so


24
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:50,120
we can get the India community going. Please come find me and talk to me if you would be


25
00:02:50,120 --> 00:03:11,880
interested. Otherwise, I will definitely come find you. Thank you.
