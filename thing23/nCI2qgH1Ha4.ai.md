## Overview

In this video, Yan Michalevsky, co-founder of [Cryptosat](https://cryptosat.com/), discusses their work on building the trust infrastructure for Web3 applications in space. Cryptosat focuses on launching, building, and integrating satellites into low Earth orbits for specific Web3 use cases. Yan provides real-world examples of how their project contributes to trusted setups and cryptographic schemes, and how it can be applied to decentralized cloud computing.

### CryptoSat Mission and Achievements

Cryptosat aims to build the trust infrastructure for Web3 in space through the development, integration, and deployment of satellites into low Earth orbits. The purpose of these satellites is to serve Web3 use cases, cryptographic protocols, and confidential computing. The project has launched two satellites already, one in May 2022 and another one in January 2023. CryptoSat has also participated in the KCG ceremony related to Ethereum scaling and creating trusted setups.

### Architecture and Tools

The satellites' onboard computer and servers are designed for the cryptographic operations the company aims to perform. Users can directly issue requests to the satellites via APIs or connect to ground station infrastructures. Cryptosat also provides a satellite tracker, the [CryptoSat Simulator](https://simulator.cryptosat.io/), which serves as an onboarding tool for developers and showcases various use cases for the satellite.

### Real-World Use Cases

Cryptosat serves several practical use cases, one of which is trusted setups for cryptographic schemes. Some cryptographic schemes require specific public parameters to be generated in a trusted execution environment. Two examples of this include ZK-SNARKs, a proof system used in the Ethereum platform, and polynomial commitments, used in the KZG ceremony. By providing a trusted execution environment, Cryptosat can help produce authentic public parameters.

### Decentralized Cloud Compute and Confidentiality

Yan Michalevsky discusses how providing such trusted execution environments on satellite can be integrated with decentralized cloud computing. By creating physically isolated environments in space, Cryptosat can ensure the confidentiality and integrity of sensitive workloads. Yan provides specific examples of how Cryptosat can integrate into the architectures of [Bacayau](https://baca.yau/) and [Super Protocol]() as trusted execution environments, and explains the process of generating encryption and signing keys for attestation.

## Key Takeaways

- Cryptosat is building the trust infrastructure for Web3 applications in space by developing, integrating, and launching satellites into low Earth orbits to serve various Web3 use cases.
- The project provides APIs and tracking tools for developers to interact with the satellites and explore their use cases.
- One practical use case for Cryptosat's satellites is trusted setups for cryptographic schemes like ZK-SNARKs and polynomial commitments.
- Cryptosat's trusted execution environments can be integrated with decentralized cloud computing architectures, such as Bacayau and Super Protocol, for increased confidentiality and integrity.
- Attestation and key generation are vital components of the Cryptosat project, ensuring that user data is encrypted and authenticated via the satellite.
