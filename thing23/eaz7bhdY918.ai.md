## Overview

In this video, Iryna Tsimashenka introduces Bacalhau, a decentralized compute network that provides an efficient and cost-effective way to process off-chain computations. Bacalhau leverages the power of a distributed network of nodes to perform complex tasks that process data. This presentation covers the advantages, developer experience, main applications, and overall vision for Bacalhau.

## Article

Hello everyone! In this talk, I am excited to present Bacalhau, a low-cost compute project that forms the third pillar of the Filecoin masterplan. Bacalhau is a Portuguese word that translates to "cod" in English, and in our context, it stands for "compute-over-data."

### What is Bacalhau?

Bacalhau is a decentralized compute network offering an efficient and cost-effective way to process off-chain computations. Unlike traditional computing systems, Bacalhau harnesses the power of a distributed network of nodes to execute complex tasks processing data. This approach sets Bacalhau apart from other decentralized compute networks due to its efficient computing architecture and fault-tolerant design.

### Why do we need Bacalhau?

There are several reasons why Bacalhau is essential:

1. **Large data has gravity**: It is costly to move and store data for processing. Bacalhau is efficient in running jobs over data stored on IPFS, as it sends the source code to where the data is instead of moving data around.
2. **Reduced complexity**: Bacalhau simplifies the process of managing compute jobs by offering a uniform platform for managing jobs across different smart contracts.
3. **Fault tolerance**: If nodes fail during the computation process, Bacalhau triggers the network to find another executor node to complete the job accurately.
4. **Increased reliability**: Bacalhau provides reliable network partitioning and resistant orchestration, ensuring job completion in the face of network disruptions.
5. **Enhanced security**: By minimizing data movement, Bacalhau brings compute over data, thereby improving security.

### Developer Experience

Developers using Bacalhau will need to send data where it's best stored, ideally on IPFS or Filecoin. Bacalhau allows for language-agnostic computations as long as your compute is dockerized or has compiled binaries. Additionally, it accommodates heterogeneous hardware, running on any GPUs and machines with high memory. Developers can use Bacalhau for batch data processing via an easy-to-use CLI or Lilliput interface.

### Applications and Vision

Bacalhau's primary applications lie within AI, ML, and financial modeling. Its high scalability enables it to handle substantial volumes of data and extensive computations. The vision for Bacalhau is to transform data collection and processing by providing developers with simple, first-class distributed tools and fostering new collaborations within the ecosystem.

Lastly, Wes Floyd, the Product Manager for Bacalhau, covers a demo of Lilliput and other use cases in the talk. If you have any questions or need insights regarding Bacalhau, feel free to reach out to us!
