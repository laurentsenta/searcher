## Overview

In this video, Anshuman Prasad presents game asset loading with IPFS and how it can revolutionize the gaming industry by improving the delivery and distribution of game assets. The talk covers the problem of game size versus storage size, the solution IPFS can offer, how this implemented in game engines like Unity and Unreal, and the future advancements in this approach.

## Game Asset Loading with IPFS

### The Problem

The game size and storage size problem arises as games become more complex and higher in fidelity, while the storage size on consoles and devices is often limited. This leads to difficulties in managing storage space and downloading large game files. The "time to fun" metric is also affected, as players have to wait for games to download before they can start playing.

### The IPFS Solution

By integrating IPFS plugins in game engines like Unity and Unreal, game developers can easily manage and load game assets asynchronously, depending on the user's actions in the game. This reduces the installation size and offers a range of benefits such as faster updates, on-demand cosmetics, better single-player game experiences, and customization according to the player's device and preferences.

### Integration in Game Engines

The implementation involves building IPFS plugins for game engines like Unity and Unreal. These plugins allow game developers to set triggers for when specific assets should be loaded and unloaded. The plugins can also be utilized during the game build process to upload assets automatically to their chosen IPFS provider.

### Benefits of IPFS in Game Asset Loading

- Reduction in installation size
- Faster updates and patching
- Cosmetics and assets on-demand
- Improved single-player game experiences
- Customization according to players' device and preferences
- Better game preservation and sharing

### Future advancements

The future advancements in game asset loading with IPFS include:

1. Automation and integration with the build pipeline, making it easier for game developers to convert their existing games.

2. Importing and handling different data formats for textures, meshes, and automatic handling of low-fidelity and high-fidelity versions of game assets based on the player's connection and preferences.

## Key Takeaways

- Game asset loading with IPFS has the potential to revolutionize the gaming industry by improving the delivery and distribution of game assets.
- IPFS can help solve the game size versus storage size problem, offering benefits such as reduced installation size and faster updates.
- Implementing IPFS in-game engines like Unity and Unreal allows game developers to easily manage and load game assets asynchronously.
- The future advancements in this approach include automation and integration with the build pipeline, as well as the ability to handle different data formats and asset fidelity.
