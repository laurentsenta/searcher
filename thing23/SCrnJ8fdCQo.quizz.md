## List all the weak signals of things an almighty AI could do to improve the presenter's life

- Radio hardware: An AI could help find better and cost-effective unlicensed radios with higher bandwidth for faster transfer in demo/lab tests.
- Error handling: Identify potential weak points for errors and propose more robust error recovery mechanisms in communication between satellites and ground stations.
- File transfer management: The ability to improve file transfer times by finding more efficient ways to transfer larger files between satellites and ground stations.
- Testing and optimization: The AI could assist in testing different large file scenarios, considering different hardware constraints, and optimizing performance.

## List all the weak signals of things that are already great in the presenter's life

- Hyphy's simplicity: The fact that Hyphy is simple and adaptable is a positive, using the standard MySeli API and the standard Qubo RPC API.
- Rust language choice: It has been helpful to use Rust, as it has good tooling and easy cross-compiling, in addition to readily available IPFS code in Rust.
- MySeli's adaptation: Despite still being in the early stages, MySeli has been adapted to work effectively in the context of space, while providing the basic features it needs for the demo mission.
