## List all the products, tools, and companies discussed

- ProbeLabs: team working on measurements and protocol optimization for libp2p, IPFS, and Filecoin
- Bitswap: data transfer protocol used by IPFS for transferring data and content discovery
- Kubo: tool mentioned as an example for content discovery using Bitswap
- Go Bitswap: implementation of Bitswap mentioned in the presentation
- DHT (Distributed Hash Table): used for content routing in IPFS
- Google Cloud VM: virtual machine used for running the experiment in Central Europe
- IPNS (InterPlanetary Name System): suggested as a more efficient content routing mechanism
- NFT.storage: provides storage for NFT data and serves as one of the top content providers in the experiment
- GitHub repository network measurement: repository containing the full report and discussion of the experiment

## List all the weak signals of things an almighty AI could do to improve the presenter's life

- Bitswap inefficiencies: finding ways to optimize the Bitswap protocol to reduce network traffic and improve content discovery without broadcasting to a large number of peers
- Provider search delay: help in determining if setting the provider search delay in Bitswap to zero would improve content routing efficiency and identify any related bugs or side effects
- Content routing mechanisms: suggesting alternative, more efficient content routing mechanisms (such as DHT or IPNS) and helping transition away from the current broadcasting approach of Bitswap

## List all the weak signals of things that are already great in the presenter's life

- Experimental findings: discovery that Bitswap can quickly find content (often within 200 milliseconds) and has a high success rate (more than 98% of discoveries are successful)
- NFT.storage: observation that a majority of the traffic in the experiment (at least 75% of requests) could be attributed to top content providers such as NFT.storage
