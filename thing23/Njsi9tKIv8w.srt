1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,900
Hey everyone, I'm Addy Wagenicht, I'm one of the co-leads of Archaeological Association


2
00:00:10,900 --> 00:00:16,720
and I'm also in the Network Goods Network funding team for Protocol Labs.


3
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:20,680
So I'm here to talk briefly about the IPFS fund.


4
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:25,520
For those of you that aren't familiar, for the last two years the IPFS fund has been


5
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:31,920
actively working to drive transformation of the IPFS infrastructure, kind of from the


6
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:37,160
reliance of primary implementations to implementations that meet the needs of the growing and scaling


7
00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:38,400
community.


8
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:44,320
So artists, people in InfoSec, developers, people developing in IoT space, Raspberry


9
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:46,360
Pi, that sort of stuff.


10
00:00:46,360 --> 00:00:51,480
The fund looks basically to catalyze and accelerate the development of IPFS implementation and


11
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:56,000
ensure high impact teams working with IPFS build and grow.


12
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:01,760
So we are like a really high risk, high return for developers, artists, InfoSec infrastructure,


13
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:04,640
so on and so forth.


14
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:10,960
We've already committed a significant amount of money and tokens to raising and building


15
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:12,640
out the IPFS community.


16
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:17,280
And we're looking for additional funding for the following years, so if any of you are


17
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:23,880
bored and rich, feel free to reach out to me or say hi.


18
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:28,400
Our cohort, with a special thanks to Dietrich, Mosh, Juan, and Molly for their inputs and


19
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:33,840
expertise, this is sort of where we were focusing for our initial build out, was like large


20
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:37,600
infrastructure, new infrastructure, building out communities.


21
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:43,600
So we have things like Chromium integration, peer-to-peer secure storage, integration of


22
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:52,120
IPFS to Unreal and Unity, Go implementation, Rust, and so on and so forth.


23
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:58,640
And then just to look at kind of deciphering or looking at kind of a larger project, one


24
00:01:58,640 --> 00:01:59,640
is 3S.


25
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:02,560
I don't think they're here right now, but if you're not familiar with them, they're


26
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:05,860
a game development studio.


27
00:02:05,860 --> 00:02:08,960
They built basically an Unreal Unity plugin.


28
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:15,120
So the cool thing about this is that you can generate pack files with the pack loader automation,


29
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:19,900
run them, mount them dynamically in runtime, which means you can basically organize any


30
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:21,840
of your games by assets.


31
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:27,120
Like folder types, it allows you to make a super centralized distribution build.


32
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:31,460
And with IPFS, obviously, you can share content just by sharing the CIDs, so there's a massive


33
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:39,200
potential for gaming to be built interoperably in the sense that you can have a full stack


34
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:45,400
of say buildings or morphing characters stored as JSON data on IPFS.


35
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:52,920
So this is something that really allows people to share basically by the render target allows


36
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:57,720
people to share things like textures or complex models, so on and so forth, between games


37
00:02:57,720 --> 00:02:58,720
that are being developed.


38
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:03,040
And this is a really major thing for people that have worked in game development, as we


39
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:06,080
all kind of know this is one of the hard things to solve, and they've been trying to solve


40
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:07,160
that.


41
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:11,280
And so when they built this plugin, they were building this because they needed the infrastructure


42
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:14,100
for their own game development, and it didn't exist.


43
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:18,000
And so IPFS Fund, along with Dietrich and Mosh, Juan, Molly, we were sort of looking


44
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:22,720
at ways to increase adoption, and we thought this was a really interesting way to go about


45
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:23,720
that.


46
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:28,160
IPFS is obviously something that's really important in the gaming future of gaming,


47
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:34,840
and so they built this plugin because they needed it for their own game development,


48
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:40,920
and in the last two months alone, they've had about 15,000 installations.


49
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:45,520
And then just a little bit about our team before we start going into awards.


50
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:51,200
Archaeological is basically leading the IPFS Fund, OPEX, financial, legal needs, and the


51
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:56,560
concept of Archaeological was basically built out so that there's no central point of ownership.


52
00:03:56,560 --> 00:04:01,840
So it's sort of like a DAO, but it's actually recognized by governments and financial institutions,


53
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:06,800
and so it makes it easier for us to navigate those complex hierarchies and systems.


54
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:12,780
Because we have no one that controls the ownership, we basically look to deploy optimized tooling


55
00:04:12,780 --> 00:04:15,320
and infrastructure for funding with strong feedback loops.


56
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:21,320
So Dietrich and Mosh, Juan and Molly, have been really the drivers of the IPFS Fund,


57
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:23,360
helping us make those decisions.


58
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:27,720
And then the core team is myself, Evan, Mauro, who have been tweaking and structuring the


59
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:32,000
mechanics for the last year, dealing with things like banking collapses and exchange


60
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,920
collapses.


61
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:37,280
And so our background is like a mix of research, open hardware.


62
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:42,080
I was in open hardware for about 10 years, developing out a lot of open hardware systems,


63
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:46,280
protocols, anything that you need around Raspberry Pi or Arduino, I'm happy to build that out


64
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:47,280
for you.


65
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:53,440
Evan's obviously been leading out research, and Mauro was the head of CEO for blockchain


66
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:58,720
at Crypto Bitcoin Swiss.


67
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:02,560
And then before we announce the winners, this is something that we've all been sort of working


68
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:03,560
on on the side.


69
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:08,340
It's a little bit of alpha before we get into the rest of this.


70
00:05:08,340 --> 00:05:13,360
So one of the things I've been wanting to work on is solving, essentially, in 2023,


71
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:18,680
blockchain mechanisms for proactive real-time distribution of funding allocation.


72
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:23,640
Having worked in open hardware and open source, one of the major issues is retroactive funding,


73
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:27,400
because you still need a runway to basically build out your ideas, and no one wants to


74
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:32,360
necessarily fund open source, although there are some, like, key angels in there.


75
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:36,120
So I was looking at ways that we could have people who are already doing things with their


76
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:37,120
tokens.


77
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:41,720
Phil, for example, is what we're looking and using right now with GILF.


78
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:47,760
This allows you to allocate some of the return you get on staking or different pooling mechanisms


79
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:53,080
into public goods in things like IPFS and the Filecoin FEM community.


80
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:55,240
And so I started working on this.


81
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:58,000
It's on the Hyperspace testnet.


82
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:03,400
If anyone wants to, like, hammer break a smart contract, I would love to put you on the multisig


83
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:07,760
and just send you some faucet fill and see if we can break it together.


84
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:11,300
But we're looking at sort of making this so it proactively funds all of your projects


85
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:15,560
and allows you to get distributions automatically, transparently on chain, because I think that's


86
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:17,120
the future of funding.


87
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:22,320
I'm also working on things like governance mechanisms with quadratic voting and introducing


88
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:27,120
impact certificates and impact evaluators on chain so that all of that can be transparently


89
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:30,680
tracked, and there's a lot less bureaucracy and red tape and delays and all that stuff


90
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:33,360
that isn't sexy and no one wants to talk about.


91
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:38,580
So that's all stuff that I've been working on for this year and hopefully for next year.


92
00:06:38,580 --> 00:06:41,520
This is a little screenshot of it on testnet.


93
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:45,360
Once again, if you want to test it, I'm thrilled to have you do that.


94
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:47,980
Bonus points if you break it.


95
00:06:47,980 --> 00:06:51,720
And then I want to switch really quickly, because I think I'm already out of time, on


96
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:53,920
the IPFS community impact awards.


97
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:57,960
I don't know if, Dietrich, you want to come up here and jazz it up also with me, but these


98
00:06:57,960 --> 00:07:00,560
are awards that are every six months.


99
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:04,640
They're projects that are crowdsourced by the community and voted.


100
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:10,480
So we want to say congratulations to the 28 winners.


101
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:17,200
Really, special thanks to all the people that submitted projects.


102
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:23,560
So this fund only goes to projects that are submitted, so thank you for finding the projects


103
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:25,680
that matter to you and adding them.


104
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:30,280
These were not curated by this team or Protocol Labs or the fund.


105
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:32,960
These were projects submitted by you.


106
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:35,360
Some of these projects are you.


107
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:38,000
So thank you for submitting.


108
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,280
Thank you also to everybody who voted.


109
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:41,800
We're going to be doing this regularly.


110
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:45,400
Yeah, we'll release them every six months, and we'll do it.


111
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:50,600
I'll try to really spray the news across every channel we've got, so just check out Discord,


112
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:53,240
Slack, Telegram, Twitter, whatever you've got.


113
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:57,080
We'll let you know about the voting and submissions, because the more of you that contribute, the


114
00:07:57,080 --> 00:07:59,840
more exciting this will get.


115
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:01,880
So thanks, everybody, and congratulations.


116
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:05,960
And thank you for working on this and building the things that you build, because it gives


117
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:34,240
us something to reward so you can do more of it.
