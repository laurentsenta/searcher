1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,600
So Dietrich put me here in the spotlight to talk about ProbeLab, which is another way


2
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:16,520
of saying data-driven protocol design and optimization.


3
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:18,240
So this is what we do.


4
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:25,000
We're collecting and analyzing protocol data that make up all the components of the IPFS


5
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,360
network.


6
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:33,560
Because you know, things sometimes might work, but not in ways that you want them to or expect


7
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:35,880
them to.


8
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:40,960
So you've got to go and dig into the details to see how things work.


9
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:44,440
And that's what we do at ProbeLab.


10
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:50,200
If you navigate to probelab.io, you'll find this new web page and a collection of plots


11
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:55,880
out of the tools that we have put together in order to dig into the details and see how


12
00:00:55,880 --> 00:01:00,200
the protocols actually perform.


13
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:05,640
For example, you're going to see DHT lookup measurements from several different regions


14
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:07,840
of the world.


15
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:13,360
What is unique about what we're doing is that it's not just a collection of plots, it's


16
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:14,880
got context as well.


17
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:21,480
So we're including details about what the experiments look like, what did we do, why


18
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:28,800
did we do it this way, as well as links to normally GitHub repositories where the tools


19
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:31,140
that we have used live.


20
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:38,660
So you get a whole view of what we've done to see if it's convenient for your purposes.


21
00:01:38,660 --> 00:01:43,200
What we're also doing is that we're producing weekly reports, which you might have seen


22
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:44,480
around.


23
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:51,440
And these are kind of snapshots of the performance and health of the network on a weekly basis.


24
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:55,680
So more kind of short term and bounded.


25
00:01:55,680 --> 00:02:00,280
As part of that, for example, we're monitoring a bunch of websites, the time to first byte


26
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:03,920
from again from several different regions.


27
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:09,440
Your website might be there, so go check how it performs.


28
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:15,880
And we compare the time to first byte from several different regions through Kubo and


29
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:19,840
through HTTP, just to see where we are.


30
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:25,280
This week, for example, you'll see that more often than not, content through IPFS, through


31
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:30,120
Kubo, is loading faster than HTTP.


32
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:31,120
Which is great.


33
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:36,000
It could be, you know, content addressing and universal caching that make up all the


34
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
magic.


35
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,400
So go check it out, see if your website is there.


36
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:45,240
If it's not and you want it to be, just come talk to us and we can probably add it.


37
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:53,000
Now we know that IPFS as a system is composed of many content routing subsystems.


38
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:57,800
And we know that we are focusing on a few of them right now.


39
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:03,760
Primarily the IPFS public DHT, but also we're looking into bitswap, hydras, and so on.


40
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:10,960
Now as we go on, we want to expand to other content routing systems, either on our own


41
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:13,040
or with your help.


42
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:18,880
So if you're building a protocol, if you have a protocol or a content routing subsystem,


43
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:26,560
and have measurement and monitoring tools, come talk to us and we can work together to


44
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:31,760
showcase how brilliant is what you're doing.


45
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:33,920
So where to find all these numbers?


46
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:36,720
Right now we have two places.


47
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:38,200
You have two places to monitor.


48
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:45,280
One is stats.ipfs.network, which points to the weekly reports, which is, as I said, a


49
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:49,760
snapshot, a summary of the health and performance of the network.


50
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:56,120
And then it's probelab.io, which is what I introduced before that, which is more detailed,


51
00:03:56,120 --> 00:04:02,880
you know, nitty gritty stuff about protocols, their parameters, you know, how does the performance


52
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:04,680
evolve if you change some of them.


53
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:07,800
So it goes into much greater depth.


54
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:12,960
Now soon, what we're going to do is that we're going to bundle everything under stats.ipfs.network


55
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:17,280
so that you can navigate from there to different places.


56
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:19,920
Yeah, that's it.


57
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:26,740
We're having a measuring IPFS track after this session here in a room near you.


58
00:04:26,740 --> 00:04:28,840
So figure it out.


59
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:33,680
Come with your questions and come to find out more of what we're doing.


60
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:34,680
Thank you.


61
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:37,840
And I will put in the spotlight Will Scott, I think.


62
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:38,840
Thank you.


63
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:39,840
Thank you.


64
00:04:39,840 --> 00:05:03,980
We'll see you in ten.
