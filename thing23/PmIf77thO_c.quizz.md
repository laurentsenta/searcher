## List all the products, tools, and companies discussed

- IPFS Gateway Implementation: A tool to ensure HTTP gateways comply with the IPFS specification
- Go: The language the gateway conformance testing tool is written in
- Kubo Gateway: An example of an IPFS gateway that the testing tool can be applied to
- CAR Gateway: Another IPFS gateway being tested by the conformance testing tool
- Bifrost Gateway: Another IPFS gateway being tested by the conformance testing tool
- GitHub Actions: Used in automating the running of the testing tool

## List all the weak signals of things an almighty AI could do to improve the presenter's life

- Implementing tests with randomness: Introducing random test cases to detect false positives or false negatives more accurately
- Developing self-testing features: Ensuring the test suite is able to detect regressions and verify if it's actually testing the expected behavior
- Expanding coverage of the IPFS specification: Including all aspects of the spec in the testing tool, ensuring a more comprehensive evaluation
- Improve feedback and debugging: Providing a more detailed report on test failures, as well as additional context and tips for troubleshooting

## List all the weak signals of things that are already great in the presenter's life

- Ability to run tests and validate compliance: The testing tool is already being used to assess compliance with the IPFS specification in three projects (Kubo, CAR, and Bifrost Gateways)
- Progress made in migrating tests: Around 30% of tests from Kubo have already been transferred to the new testing tool, with a goal to reach 100% in the future
- Gateway Conformance Testing Workshop: An opportunity to gather feedback and help developers implement new tests with the tool
- Collaboration with experts: Working closely with Robin to ensure the tool aligns with web platform testing standards and best practices
