## Overview

In this video, Wes Floyd introduces Project Lilypad, which focuses on the combination of on-chain state and off-chain compute through an end-to-end capability. The project aims to make smart contracts and other applications more powerful and versatile by enabling off-chain compute operations. He also demonstrates the Waterlily platform that utilizes stable diffusion and neural style transfer techniques for AI image generation. This combination will give rise to new applications and possibilities in the rapidly evolving world of Web3.

Thank you all for joining our session. As Irina mentioned, we're very passionate about off-chain compute. Off-chain compute is really only interesting when you can tie the trustlessness guarantees of a distributed consensus technology like FEVM. So my brief session is going to talk about the power of on-chain state, bridging it to invoke off-chain compute. We really want to have the best of both worlds.

Project Lilypad is the first component to invoke Bac√∏yau from any smart contract. This project enables developers to build FVM smart contracts with complex, off-chain compute capabilities while maintaining trustlessness. For more information about Lilypad, check out the [GitHub URL](https://github.com/bacoyau/lilypad).

The demo platform, Waterlily, combines on-chain and off-chain compute to generate AI-enhanced images. It leverages the FVM network to generate user-requested images and apply artistic styles using neural style transfer techniques. This makes it possible to create visuals that would be too computationally intensive or too large to fit into a smart contract.

Off-chain compute powered by Lilypad has the potential to drive innovation in various fields, such as data DAOs, DeFi, decentralized social media, and more. It provides the flexibility and scalability needed to grow and evolve the Web3 ecosystem while maintaining the trust and security provided by the blockchain.
