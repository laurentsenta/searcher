## Overview

In this video, Brooklyn Zelenka introduces UCAN (User Controlled Authorization Network), a decentralized authorization approach designed to upgrade the current stateful auth mechanisms like OAuth. UCAN is based on Capability-based security and focuses on simplifying, securing, and opening up possibilities of auth to power a new internet built on decentralized technologies.

Auth mechanisms have evolved over time, with access control lists (ACLs) being one of the earliest forms designed for people sharing terminals. However, capabilities have been explored as a more powerful, secure, and flexible alternative since the 1970s.

UCAN takes capabilities a step further by working towards becoming a Trojan Horse for Web 3 in Web 2. By building on widely supported technologies, UCAN aims to create a cohesive auth solution that works seamlessly with today's existing solutions.

In UCAN, the user is their own OAuth server, with a JWT (JSON Web Token) being the bearer token representing a capability. UCAN is extensible and can adapt as needed to suit various systems and workflows.

## Key Takeaways

- UCAN is a capability-based auth mechanism designed for decentralized systems.
- UCAN is designed to be inter-operable with existing auth solutions and encourages simplicity and secure design.
- JWTs represent capabilities in UCAN, providing a bearer token for authorization.
- The UCAN ecosystem is built on top of existing standards and tools, making it easy to adopt and integrate with existing solutions.
- UCAN can be used to delegate and revoke access, enforce time-bound restrictions, and share access with others.
- There is ongoing work on improving UCAN, with multiple implementations and support for various decentralized technologies.
- UCAN is positioned as a Trojan Horse for bringing Web 3 concepts and technologies to the broader Web 2 audience.
