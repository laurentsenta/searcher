# Durin: An Introduction to IPFS on Mobile

Durin is an app built for exploring IPFS use cases. Initially designed to support read and share flows, it is also an excellent platform for experimenting with like-client protocol implementation, proximity transports, and where's my stuff problem. Available on Android and iOS, Durin supports uploading and IPFS colon slash slash links with protocol handling which are converted to HTTPS for sharing.

Durin is designed for IPFS-enabled apps and acts as a lightweight base for these apps. It is user-friendly and well-documented, with tutorials available for forking the project and start building. Similarly, it is also a testing ground for any experimental ideas that come up along the way.

Durin's racing or caching gateway feature is the most lightweight way of accessing IPFS on mobile. The speed and health of the gateways are ranked and checked on an interval, and the app returns the fastest gateway available.

Durin transforms IPFS to HTTPS, similar to the Companion browser extension. Also, Durin's uploads are done through web3.storage, with a built-in sharing feature that supports airdrop messaging, generating QR codes, and adding share targets. Finally, it is possible to integrate a sharing option to Durin from within the photos app.

Since its announcement, several new features have been added to Durin. Users can now share directly to Durin, which will auto-upload, generate CID and share links. A new design has been implemented, and there are plans to add more metrics.

Soon to be shipping, the updated version of Durin also features several bug fixes and added gateways. It also includes a featured apps list that looks for IPFS-enabled apps or things that run on IPFS and have a good experience on mobile.

The roadmap for Durin looks promising, with several plans for new features in the works. The Durin team is also looking to add it to the FDroid store and create a tutorial for forking the project.

Contributors to Durin are encouraged to build their version of IPFS-enabled apps, submit ideas, and talk to the Durin team regarding any mobile or IPFS-related projects. The team seeks input to help improve, enhance and develop the app further.

In conclusion, Durin is an excellent tool for exploring IPFS use cases, particularly in a mobile environment. It is user-friendly, lightweight, and its gateway feature ensures the fastest and healthiest gateway. It is also an exciting testing ground for experimental ideas, which could lead to the creation of innovative apps in the IPFS ecosystem.
