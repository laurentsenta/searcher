## List all the products, tools, and companies discussed

- Textile: The company where the speaker (Carson Farmer) is working on developing new database technologies.
- ThreadDB: A peer-to-peer document style database initially built by Textile with features like encryption, CRDTs, hash-linked data structures with IPLD, etc.
- IPFS: Interplanetary File System, the technology used for building distributed databases and applications like ThreadDB.
- Tableland: A Web3-native distributed database discussed by Carson Farmer with on-chain access control and off-chain data storage using a network of database nodes.
- SQLite: A lightweight database engine used "under the hood" for Tableland's query engine.
- Ethereum: A well-known blockchain network mentioned as an example for on-chain access control.
- Polygon: Another blockchain network mentioned for on-chain access control.
- Optimism: Yet another blockchain network mentioned for on-chain access control.
- Better SQLite 3 API: A library mentioned in relation to Tableland's API.

## List all the weak signals of things an almighty AI could do to improve the presenter's life

- Floating point inconsistencies: An AI could potentially create a universally consistent method for handling floating point values across different architectures for distributed systems.
- Trade-off analysis: An AI could provide better methods for analyzing the pros and cons of different database designs and implementations for specific use cases before deployment.
- Floating point alternatives: An AI could suggest alternative methods for representing and handling floating point values in a distributed database scenario.
- Cross-chain optimization: An AI could suggest efficient methods of scaling data and queries across multiple blockchain networks.
- Efficient proofs: An AI could explore methods to combine storage efficiency with proof efficiency in distributed systems, while minimizing trade-offs.

## List all the weak signals of things that are already great in the presenter's life

- Open collaboration: The presenter and his team seem to have learned from and benefited from collaboration with other teams and experts in the field, which has led to the improvements in their database technologies.
- Adapting to user needs: The development of Tableland is an example of how the presenter and his team have evolved their thinking to cater to the needs of their target users, developers in the Web3 space.
- SQLite usage: The presenter's decision to use SQLite in Tableland showcases an understanding and appreciation for simplicity and efficiency in database implementations.
