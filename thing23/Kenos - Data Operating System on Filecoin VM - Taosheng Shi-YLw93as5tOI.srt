00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Hello everyone, thank you for coming here. Let us get started on my topics.


2
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:20,000
K-Notes, Data Origin Systems on Filecoin Virtual Machine.


3
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Let us get started from data economy with the launch of Filecoin VM.


4
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:38,000
You know, for the past month, with the launch of Filecoin virtual machines,


5
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:50,000
there are more than just a strategy opportunities, or you can explore in the Filecoin ecosystems.


6
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Basically, there is a new economy have just been born, the data economy.


7
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:02,000
This will drive the industry disruption, lots of new business models,


8
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:12,000
and especially with China government have given many policy support for the Web3 data economy,


9
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:18,000
and like you know, the Web3 festival is happening in Hong Kong, it just finished in Hong Kong.


10
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:26,000
So that is a good opportunity with the Filecoin virtual machine launch.


11
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:32,000
As you know, data is a valuable resource, data has proven to be a valuable resource.


12
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Many success stories are built on it.


13
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:47,000
In 2020, YouTube reaped almost $7 billion from just revenue, ad revenue.


14
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:54,000
And the Internet, as we know, today hosts some of the most important data.


15
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:59,000
It is the together from the fabric of who you are, where you are, where you're from,


16
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:03,000
and where you are going, and what do you like, and what you don't like.


17
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:09,000
But all this data currently is hosted by the central authorities,


18
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:16,000
and you can freely use the platform, but you use the data to exchange it,


19
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:28,000
a free service, but your data is exchanged as other revenues.


20
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,000
And Gartner has predicted that by 2022,


21
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:39,000
information will be a critical asset to 90% of enterprise corporate strategies.


22
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Data is increasingly acknowledged as a valuable resource,


23
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:50,000
and this present is another issue organizations are incentivized to collect as much data as possible,


24
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:56,000
but become stalled out by the limits on how they can use it.


25
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Okay, let us meet Kanos and the DataDos stack.


26
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Kanos is the data operating system for DataDos, for Web3 DataDos.


27
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,000
DataDos stack is an open source data-first stack,


28
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:13,000
advancing the technology and adoption of Kanos.


29
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Kanos takes the tank of interdependencies in the current state of art,


30
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:24,000
and make it more coherent and reliable and easier to deploy.


31
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Basically, Kanos included these four key components, four important parts.


32
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:39,000
The first one is operating system for Web3 DataDos,


33
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:46,000
and the combined smart contract, and distribute the compute and the field storage market into one package.


34
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:52,000
And the IPRD polytrace for handling the large amounts of structured data,


35
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:56,000
which could not be available otherwise.


36
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:01,000
And easy to use front-end for creating DOS, managing their data size,


37
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,000
and running computation over their data.


38
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:14,000
So that is the basic important part of the data operating system.


39
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Okay, as you can see here, from the left part is maybe,


40
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:26,000
and currently ongoing there are a lot of DataDos are building Fairclone VM,


41
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:30,000
but there are many duplicate components and duplicate service,


42
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:34,000
and the different dependency between these DataDos.


43
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:39,000
We can synergy all these efforts together to build a data operating system,


44
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:44,000
just like the right part of the diagram.


45
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:50,000
You can see here we can have a call service in the data operating systems,


46
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:57,000
and different frameworks for different DataDos.


47
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:04,000
And all these service and framework are built on Fairclone VM.


48
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:19,000
The different DataDos could build their dedicated customized business logics on this data operating system.


49
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Basically, if we look into the data operating system, there are three different planes.


50
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:32,000
From bottom to top, the first plane is the data plane, as you know,


51
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Fairclone, IPFS, and other different storage solutions,


52
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:45,000
for example, Fairproof, yesterday in the database panel.


53
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:52,000
All these data solutions are using IPRD data format.


54
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:57,000
All these data storage solutions are data plane.


55
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:02,000
We can leverage the parity indexing and other indexing technologies


56
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:10,000
to indexing the big data of IPRD data.


57
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:14,000
In the middle of this stack, there is a control plane.


58
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:19,000
The control plane, as I mentioned before, is the call service and the framework service.


59
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:29,000
The framework includes the contracts and provides the infrastructure to easily create and manage your DOS and your plugins.


60
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:40,000
The call primitives are intended to be used by users and implemented by developers of the DOS frameworks.


61
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Maybe there are other service that could be used to bridge external services.


62
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,000
On top of the control plane, there is the application plane.


63
00:06:52,000 --> 00:07:01,000
You can use the frontend to easily create your DOS, scale your DOS, launch your DOS, and deploy your DOS, data DOS.


64
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:09,000
You can also do some experimental for data DOS.


65
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Let us look at the data DOS stack.


66
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Basically, this is a stack discussed much inside the protocol library.


67
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:30,000
You can see here is the IPRD data layer, the Faircoin VM layer, bridge layer, and the business logic layer.


68
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:45,000
But the most important is from bottom to top, the CAD is a very key important data.


69
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:49,000
I didn't identify from bottom to top.


70
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
You can see here.


71
00:07:51,000 --> 00:08:08,000
CAD could be in Stardew providers and also could be in the smart contracts and also could be in Oracle service and other data DOS services.


72
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:18,000
The most important is we wanted to, you know, for Web3 data DOS, there are many big data of IPRD data size.


73
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:24,000
So we wanted to introduce the polytree for indexing.


74
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Polytree basically is a possibility search tree just like a B-tree in the traditional database.


75
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:38,000
We have much discussion in the yesterday's database panel.


76
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:52,000
You can find many materials on the internet about the polytree and how to combine the content addressable properties with indexing properties.


77
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:57,000
I think that is all my introduction about the data operating systems.


78
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Any questions?


79
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Hi, Daoshan, could you please tell me what's the main key features?


80
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Okay.


81
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:15,000
I think the key features here are just put on the slides.


82
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:22,000
The first one is operating system for Web3 data DOS dedicated for Web3 data DOS.


83
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:34,000
That is different with other DOS, for example, for Ethereum, traditional, not traditional, I mean, just the DOS, not the data DOS.


84
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:41,000
The second is combined the smart contract distributed compute and the storage markets together in one package.


85
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:44,000
The third one is IPRD polytree for indexing.


86
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:52,000
The third one is easy to use front-end to creating and deploying launch your data DOS.


87
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
That's all.


88
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Thank you.


89
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Thank you.


90
00:09:55,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Thank you.
