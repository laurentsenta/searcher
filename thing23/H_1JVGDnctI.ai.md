## Overview

In this video, Fabrice Desré presents the challenges that come from the current security and privacy model of the web and how content-based addressing can provide better solutions. Fabrice covers principles of web security, web privacy, and introduces web tiles, an innovative approach to improve the current web stack with content-based addressing. He also presents some sample use cases while mentioning some unanswered questions about this approach.

## Content

Over the years, the web has evolved and adapted to new use cases, APIs, and advances in technology. This evolution has necessitated the development of web security and privacy principles. The same-origin policy is a crucial aspect of web security, which prevents malicious code from exfiltrating information.

Some limitations stem from the current web security and privacy model, as there is a fine line between ensuring user safety and privacy. Fabrice Desré talks about isolated web apps and web tiles as alternative approaches to addressing the limitations of the existing model.

Using content-based addressing, web tiles provide a new perspective on delivering data and code. Web tiles are characterized as:

- Safe by default: Ensuring privacy by design
- Powerful APIs: Allowing deeper hardware access without compromising security
- Content traceability: Providing integrity guarantees
- Installation: Storing and installing web tiles through the user agent

Fabrice Desré demonstrates various use cases for web tiles, such as:

- Headless UI: Tiles can perform functions without needing a user-visible UI
- Document editing and processing: Editing images or other media files using web tiles
- Remote media streaming: Sharing and streaming media content between devices

However, there are still some unanswered questions related to discovering and updating web tiles and finding the right balance between centralized search engines and decentralized solutions.

## Key Takeaways

- Web security and privacy principles have evolved over time to tackle new challenges.
- Content-based addressing provides a new perspective on delivering data and code through web tiles.
- Web tiles offer safety, powerful APIs, content traceability, and easy installation.
- Use cases for web tiles include headless UI, document editing and processing, and remote media streaming.
