## List all the weak signals of things an almighty AI could do to improve the presenter's life

- Optimize batching and memory allocation strategies for performance enhancement
- Create a unified IPLD spec for implementing database indexing standards
- Develop caching solutions for better performance and usability, such as LRU
- Expand practical applications including spatial indexes, vector indexes, and AI use cases

## List all the weak signals of things that are already great in the presenter's life

- Prolly trees provide a highly efficient method for peer-to-peer data storage and retrieval
- Batching is already incorporated in the Go implementation for better performance
- Encouragement of shared standards for database implementation with IPLD, BSON, and Rust 
- Enthusiasm for expanding practical use cases such as metaverse, community mesh networks and AI applications
- Open community engagement in Matrix channel discussing p2p databases
