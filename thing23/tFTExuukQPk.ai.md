## Overview

In this video, Samy Fodil introduces their work on building a decentralized cloud computing platform called TauBite. The platform aims to overcome the limitations of centralized cloud platforms by providing a highly scalable, efficient, and secure alternative. Samy covers the components needed for such a platform and provides examples of how their system works, along with a demonstration of various tools created for developers using TauBite.

## Building a Decentralized Cloud Computing Platform

To build a decentralized cloud computing platform, Samy Fodil explains that two main components are needed: a peer-to-peer network and cloud features implemented as peer-to-peer protocols. Various protocols and layers are used within the TauBite platform, which provides a scalable solution for decentralized applications and services.

## Serverless, WebAssembly, and Execution

TauBite utilizes serverless architecture with WebAssembly as the primary code execution format. This allows for location-independent, secure, and efficient code execution. Various examples, such as IPFS gateway and image processing, are provided to showcase the power and speed of serverless WebAssembly functions within the TauBite platform.

## Tools and SDKs for Developers

TauBite provides several tools and SDKs for developers to work with, including WebConsole, Tau CLI, Dreamland, Audible, and more. The Go and Rust SDKs are also fully developed and provide a rich set of features for developers to create serverless functions that can interact with various resources and services within the TauBite ecosystem. Samy demonstrates how to use Tau CLI and shows examples of various functions created with the Go SDK.

## Future Plans and Roadmap

The TauBite team is working on adding SIRCOM support for easy ZK proof creation and verification, as well as serverless container support to enable more diverse use cases like AI and Python execution. The team is also exploring methods to improve security and privacy for accessing sensitive data within decentralized applications.

## Key Takeaways

- TauBite is a decentralized cloud computing platform built using a peer-to-peer network and cloud features implemented as peer-to-peer protocols.
- Serverless architecture and WebAssembly are used for efficient, secure, and location-independent code execution within TauBite.
- Developers can use various tools and SDKs, like WebConsole and Tau CLI, to create serverless applications that run within the TauBite ecosystem.
- Future plans for TauBite include adding support for SIRCOM and ZK proofs, as well as serverless container support for more diverse use cases.
