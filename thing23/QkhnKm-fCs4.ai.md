### What is Durin?

Durin is an iOS and Android app for exploring IPFS use cases, initially with read and share flows. It supports the uploading and handling of IPFS links and converts them to HTTPS for sharing. Durin aims to be a base for IPFS enabled apps, allowing people to easily fork the project and build upon it. It also serves as a testing ground for any experimental ideas involving mobile and IPFS.

### How Does It Work?

Durin uses a racing or caching gateway to provide the most lightweight way to access IPFS on mobile. It ranks gateways based on their speed and health and allows users to choose their preferred gateway. Uploaded files are handled by web3.storage, and the app also supports QR codes and share targets for easy file transfer.

### What's New Since IPFS Camp?

Durin now includes a share target feature that enables sharing directly from the Photos app (on iOS). The design has been improved, bugs fixed, and new gateways added. A featured apps list highlights IPFS enabled apps for mobile devices.

### Future Plans and How to Contribute

Future plans for Durin include possible integrations with IPFS Search and other featured apps, exploration of file encryption, photo backups using FVM and Filecoin, and support for contacts API and wallet integrations. Developers can contribute by forking the project, submitting ideas, hacking with the Durin team, or contributing to IPIP discussions.

Durin is available for download in the Google Play Store and the App Store. It's also available on GitHub for those who want to contribute or build their own IPFS app.
