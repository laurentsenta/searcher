00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,080
Hello, my name is Boris Mann. I work for Fission. I have worked in open source for a really


2
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:13,480
long time. One of the things I like to say is that I worked in open source when that


3
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:23,520
was still a radical act. We fought a lot against Microsoft FUD and other things like that.


4
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:30,320
Along with that, we practiced open source governance funding and etc. a lot. We were in the thick


5
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:35,760
of it and it was something that was much discussed because it was newer and people were figuring


6
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:42,520
it out and it felt like there was lots of camaraderie and someone to fight against in


7
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:54,280
big proprietary software. Now we're on the other side of that. We won. Woo! Amazing.


8
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:59,480
Lots and lots of software is licensed under an open source license of some kind. That


9
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:05,780
means it can be highly reused. Great. Super fantastic. A whole generation of developers


10
00:01:05,780 --> 00:01:13,800
have grown up essentially with being like, yeah, I guess I put this on a code sharing


11
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:19,000
site and I just use one of these open source licenses that I don't think very much about


12
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:25,880
and there you go. That's open source. My three definitions of open source are one,


13
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:34,720
it's a legal innovation. In fact, those licenses were created using the tools of copyright.


14
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:39,960
Also, sometimes known the open source stuff as copy left to lock open the codes that could


15
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:47,760
be reused and shared. That was an innovation at the legal layer. The next one really is


16
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:56,640
the practice of peer-based co-production of software. It's a long word, but that's the


17
00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:00,800
part of like, oh yeah, multiple people work on stuff and have some systems and go back


18
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:08,640
and forth and have some sort of governance model, which often we mainly from open source


19
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:15,160
are familiar with classic ones like benevolent dictator for life or BDFL. Again, long time


20
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:22,000
open source will be like, ha ha, lol, right. If Joe who runs the project likes you, it's


21
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:28,720
always Joe and they're a middle-aged white guy, then your stuff gets in. This is no way


22
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:34,680
to form a system of government. We may as well use a system where ladies and lakes give


23
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:42,680
us swords to how decisions get made. The third one is ideology. I for one, believe that open


24
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:50,560
source software is very important. We have lots of big challenges and if we're constantly


25
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:57,320
having to license or rewrite software because it isn't open, it doesn't get us moving into


26
00:02:57,320 --> 00:03:06,720
those big, bigger challenges. It offends me that basically there's a zero marginal cost


27
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:10,560
to copy source code. We can copy the bits. It doesn't cost anything. Go ahead, use the


28
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:21,560
source code, except for a bunch of other things. I talked about this a little bit. Governance


29
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:29,400
in part, especially in the context of something that's sort of internet first, is the classic


30
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:36,160
thing of why was I not consulted? Whether it's a commercial platform or a piece of open


31
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:44,840
source software or a neighborhood block party, people will feel bad and get grumpy if it


32
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:51,480
feels like they weren't consulted in something that was happening. In this, IPFS Filecoin


33
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:58,880
cinematic universe, we've got some major pieces of software and how are we connecting stakeholders


34
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:06,400
broadly? Is doing pull requests the only way to get priorities changed? This slide I decided


35
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:11,520
to put in as kind of a placeholder because I think that we haven't really grappled with


36
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:19,960
this. I think there's some tools like star maps that might start helping us ask these


37
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:26,680
questions of who stakeholders actually are and that double-sided link of what the responsibilities


38
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:35,240
are on each side of that link and what sort of commitments are being made.


39
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:43,880
Let's get back to funding. Funding has a lot of power because it enables people to work


40
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:54,320
on things or perhaps choose to work on things. I came up in open source when mostly North


41
00:04:54,320 --> 00:05:02,760
America and Western Europe was online and mostly relatively well-off white males had


42
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:12,960
free time that contributed to open source. It's something that I'm aware of. I benefited


43
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:23,480
from and I'm also now looking where the internet covers the entire world, how we can grow the


44
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:28,240
pool of people who can produce software and get paid for it and ideally in such a way


45
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:34,960
that it remains open source in a path that doesn't require them to step one, work for


46
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:38,720
a company. What does it mean to work on open source?


47
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:47,280
The way that funding works, a lot of this stuff looks like grants or one-off projects.


48
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:53,080
I call those more like consulting. You put together some things that you need to deliver


49
00:05:53,080 --> 00:06:01,680
and that doesn't typically get us original research and it doesn't get us long-term maintenance.


50
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:08,160
What do I mean by long-term maintenance? Really what happens if you say, oh yeah, we're going


51
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:17,240
to put out a grant to get X built. You will get a 0.8 version of X that's been paid for


52
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:23,560
and it's open source. What's next? It's open source. It's cool. We're done, right?


53
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:30,080
Just like with products, that's where the work begins. Do you pay for marketing and


54
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:38,240
community work to get it adopted? Do you pay for the next year of maintenance and adoption?


55
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:44,360
Where do new features come from? Or does it just get dropped off in some sort of shipyard


56
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:52,560
and left there? What parts of projects are experiments or


57
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:59,440
proof of concepts that might be appropriate for that kind of grant approach? What is research?


58
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:09,680
We've talked about in this ecosystem of blue-green teams or work. Blue work being more research-oriented


59
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:18,440
that unlocks new capabilities. As research is, it might not work and it might be an initial


60
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:23,200
piece of code that isn't operationalized to say run at scale or other things like that.


61
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:28,520
On the other end of things, how does important foundational libraries get built and maintained


62
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:33,440
so that many green products and companies can be built on top?


63
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:37,440
These are the two things that I think we constantly have to grapple with, especially in areas


64
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:42,400
where we're in these like web three distributed system spaces where it's like, yup, some of


65
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:47,320
this is like new original work that is going to, in many cases, hit boundaries where you're


66
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:53,320
like I need to go back to a blue team and get a solution because I'm stuck here.


67
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:56,360
I'm mostly going to have question marks throughout this thing. I don't actually have answers


68
00:07:56,360 --> 00:08:00,920
in this, just pointing to directions of what we might work on.


69
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:05,440
This is one thing that's not just a question mark. I'm a huge fan of Open Collective. If


70
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:13,760
you're not familiar with it, it's a platform where basically you can create a collective


71
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:18,680
and get a fiscal host. What this means is this unlocks the sort of thing where you have


72
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:23,760
a single maintainer running funds through their bank account. It means that you can


73
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:30,320
immediately start at the repo project working group or event level, not need a full blown


74
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:40,340
organization and give out, take in funds and give out funds in a very, very flexible way.


75
00:08:40,340 --> 00:08:48,760
It also has built in support for funding over time. People can subscribe to $5 a year, $5


76
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:57,040
a month or $500 a month if it's an organization. That's the kind of model that likely combines


77
00:08:57,040 --> 00:09:04,640
with grants to actually fund that long term maintenance for more open source contributors.


78
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:11,320
The world I'd like to get to is that we might have a certain number of contributors around


79
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:21,920
the world, perhaps specifically not in North America or Western Europe, who make $500 or


80
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:29,360
$1,000 or $2,000 a month for which that would be very impactful. That would in fact be a


81
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:43,120
small business and it is maybe a fifth the cost of hiring a global North engineer at


82
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:53,080
a full time company. Very interesting. Et cetera. There's many, many other things that


83
00:09:53,080 --> 00:10:02,640
go on from here. We are trying to do novel things in novel structures. I got involved


84
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:11,120
in part because I was very, very aligned with the ideas that Juan Benet has been thinking


85
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:15,120
about for a long time of how to build these networked organizations that work together


86
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:21,360
in a network. How do you think about network level impact? One of those things is really


87
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:29,040
encouraging everyone to not target the team or the company, but target the ecosystem.


88
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:34,080
A lot of that is like, hey, let everyone know that you're about to do X. Gather commitments.


89
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:38,880
How can we pool some needs and resources? Those resources, that's always a funny word


90
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:46,600
because in many cases it either boils down to cash or the typing fingers of N engineers.


91
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:51,080
I think there's a bunch more stuff in there around product design, adoption, promotion,


92
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:57,760
those classic things that also mostly get mixed when you hear open source project. Let's


93
00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:03,440
get more open source computers paid around the world. Let's practice governance and coordination.


94
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:09,640
So I recently participated, did anyone else in the room participate in the IPFS impact


95
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:17,840
of evaluate around? A couple of you folks. So it has an interesting interface to do quadratic


96
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:25,960
voting. Might we actually practice using those interfaces rather than just every six months?


97
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:35,720
Maybe we do them to prioritize features. Might engineering teams give out points to certain


98
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:39,520
stakeholders that they want to have involved in decision making and use quadratic voting


99
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:47,240
to prioritize things? Might we use it in scheduling our unconference schedules so we can get a


100
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:53,520
sense of who's attending what or what might be popular ahead of time? And it goes on for


101
00:11:53,520 --> 00:12:00,040
there, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera. So this is a big area. I think we're with things


102
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:07,440
like permanent full-time open source contributors who are paid by a non-organization that is


103
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:13,240
a website. These are some of the things, a lot of these things are also explored in more


104
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:19,560
web three contexts. And I'm saying we don't need to be blocked by waiting for cryptocurrency


105
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:23,960
or DAOs. We should experiment with those as well, but we should take these same patterns


106
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:30,520
and start using tools like open collective and start doing these things today. That's


107
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:32,520
all I got for you.


108
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:43,480
Questions, comments? Hi, thanks for having this talk. I think it


109
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:49,720
is super important, especially for the longterm health of something like an open standard


110
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:58,240
or open protocol. For open collective specifically, so one of the things that web three and DAOs


111
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:05,920
bring to this conversation is actually kind of similar to that impact evaluator workflow,


112
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:13,280
which is a voting mechanism. Does open collective have something like that, like a voting tool


113
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:20,160
for, or do you have to, is it just the kind of fiscal sponsorship aspect where somebody,


114
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:24,720
one email address somewhere has the key to unlocking the funds of the open collective?


115
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:29,200
So how does, in that world where you're using open collective instead of dogfooding the


116
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:35,840
web three DAO version, how do you connect that decision-making part from the community


117
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:38,320
to the budgetary part in open collective?


118
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:42,840
Yeah, it's a really good question. There's a whole bunch of other things in there where


119
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:51,560
I also think it's very important that we should be having conversations with users of software.


120
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:58,200
So like with a software library, this is usually organizations or other things like that. But


121
00:13:58,200 --> 00:14:03,880
higher up that end users should also be like, oh man, I love this software and I want to


122
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:11,960
have it stick around and $5 a month is a vote. These other systems aren't built in yet. One


123
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:20,200
of the ways that I would build that is literally say, okay, great, guess what? You get to participate


124
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:26,280
in emoji voting on our next three features. Oh no, no, you don't get to make up new ones.


125
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:29,960
We're writing the software. We know what we're doing, but we're going to do a participatory


126
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:35,920
process of saying which of these are higher priority in different ways. That's in some


127
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:42,800
ways again, like, oh damn, that's the et cetera part. That's hard, right? And in fact, it's


128
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:49,440
not built into GitHub and whether or not continuing to consolidate on one single platform of GitHub


129
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:58,280
is even a good idea. So you usually have multiple admins and everything is done transparently


130
00:14:58,280 --> 00:15:03,440
already. So budgeting, like if someone says like, I did this thing, I'd like to get paid


131
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:09,680
five hours for this thing that I did. That's relatively transparent, but a lot of those


132
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:13,640
other things you're right, like happened like outside of the bounds of that at the, at the


133
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:18,660
end of the day. So that's an area where, where we'd need to look at other things.


134
00:15:18,660 --> 00:15:24,000
Does open collective happen in API? Yeah, the entire platform is open source. It's got


135
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:33,200
web hooks. Ian built, they have some event features that are like so-so, like they're


136
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:38,680
fine. And then you actually built a whole like event website that was driven off of


137
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:50,780
open collective, right? Yeah. So basically all of the data associated with any particular


138
00:15:50,780 --> 00:15:56,120
open collective page, well, most of the important data is published as just JSON files that


139
00:15:56,120 --> 00:16:01,200
you can pull. And so we built a whole front end on our website that like pulled the list


140
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:05,920
of registered attendees and like displayed them in the website from the people who had


141
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:12,040
actually registered in open collective. To actually take them through the payment flow,


142
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:16,960
we were able to generate a specific page for each subscription tier and then just send


143
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:22,440
people directly to that page from the button on our website. One of the ways I think it


144
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:28,000
could also work with a more sort of democratic or DAO based funding mechanism is if you had


145
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:34,520
it, like, I think that Boris is right that you want the orgs receiving the funding to,


146
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:39,760
you know, maybe not necessarily be run totally democratically as a DAO, but like have admins


147
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:44,760
who are responsible for the project actually administering things. But if protocol labs


148
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:49,920
are a larger organization that has access to a lot of funds is choosing which organizations


149
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:56,000
would get open collective donations that could be run as a more democratic participatory


150
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:00,800
web three process like get coin. And then those bounties could just be paid out to open


151
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:05,000
collective orgs. And then those orgs like the thing that's great about open collective


152
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:11,200
is it's open nature. You see exactly what the org is spending all of that money on.


153
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:15,200
And so, you know, we raised more money than we needed for our conference. And we just


154
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:19,080
have a bunch of money sitting there in our fund that we've promised to use for certain


155
00:17:19,080 --> 00:17:24,800
things in the future. But like, you know, the actual accounting of hiring a different


156
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:28,920
organization to host our servers, we were able to pay them directly through open collective


157
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:34,920
because they also had an open collective. Yeah, so this is this is a very, so there's


158
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:41,040
another tool related to open collective called back your stack. And what it does, you can


159
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:46,120
go in and put your GitHub details in and it will scan all of your dependencies and will


160
00:17:46,120 --> 00:17:52,560
show you which of those orgs have open collectives. And so this is sort of this other model, right?


161
00:17:52,560 --> 00:18:00,680
So Fission has already started making sure that we're like paying our dependencies. We


162
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:05,160
want them to stick around. We want them to be stable libraries. And we should, you know,


163
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:08,080
put some money in the kitty to make that stuff happen. And of course, we can start thinking


164
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:11,960
about whether it's a star maps model or an open collective model where you actually have


165
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:17,160
very like local decision maker around like, oh, we should direct some funds over here.


166
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:30,480
And all of those flows end up being really interesting in a in a system.


167
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:34,760
Thanks Boris. Yes, just to help me get really concrete on this. We talked earlier about


168
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:37,800
maybe we should have an open collective for star map and vision would like to put money


169
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:43,480
towards that maybe PLN Drez wants to. So let's say people do who at the end of the day is


170
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:49,760
getting to decide, yes, we're going to reward this person in this part of the world $1,000


171
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:55,560
for that feature that they just produced. Yeah, yeah. So again, that that's that's the


172
00:18:55,560 --> 00:19:00,720
like formation of like, like, what is the governance model of star maps is what you're


173
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:07,240
actually asking me. Okay. And so that's not built into to open collective, very roughly


174
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:11,640
the way that I've been thinking about it is we don't want to be in a situation that it


175
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:16,000
actually just becomes consulting. There's the part of like finding some qualified individuals


176
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:20,280
who are comfortable with the code base, right? So there should be a bunch of like starter


177
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:27,080
grants that are very well defined that are basically like, hey, do this thing, do a PR,


178
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:32,480
do this, get it merged in, we'll give you 50 bucks, right? Just to like get people over


179
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:37,520
the over the bar, right? And then we've got this other tier of like fairly well scoped


180
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:42,920
it. Who does the scoping? How does that get reviewed code basically, like, this is the


181
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:48,800
same practice of doing this inside the company, one way or another, right with with with some


182
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:54,920
processes that ideally like scale, basically, where ideally, what you'd want to do is you'd


183
00:19:54,920 --> 00:20:00,120
want to find a situation where someone has the time available and the interest available


184
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:00,080
sesie»


185
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:33,220
outside of the bounds of our organization.


186
00:20:33,220 --> 00:20:36,740
Right, so either we fully staff some of these projects


187
00:20:36,740 --> 00:20:39,580
because we're doing them and they're crucial,


188
00:20:39,580 --> 00:20:42,420
which will cost 20 grand a month,


189
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:48,340
or we see if we can actually turn them


190
00:20:48,340 --> 00:20:53,100
into even more broadly supported open source projects


191
00:20:54,540 --> 00:20:58,460
that get a much wider community outside the boundaries


192
00:20:58,460 --> 00:21:01,340
of our current network, right?


193
00:21:01,340 --> 00:21:03,500
So it's call for experimentation, is that fair?


194
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:05,100
Yeah, that's fair.


195
00:21:05,100 --> 00:21:06,680
Cool, thank you.


196
00:21:12,860 --> 00:21:17,220
One of the challenges that I think IPFS specifically has


197
00:21:17,220 --> 00:21:20,620
in this area, and I know that this is really not specific


198
00:21:20,620 --> 00:21:22,500
to IPFS, you can apply it to like two star maps


199
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:24,540
or something, but one of the challenges with IPFS


200
00:21:24,540 --> 00:21:26,260
is that like at this conference,


201
00:21:26,260 --> 00:21:29,820
there's not a lot of its biggest users represented.


202
00:21:29,820 --> 00:21:33,180
And many of its largest users might actually,


203
00:21:33,180 --> 00:21:34,660
we don't know who they are,


204
00:21:34,660 --> 00:21:37,500
even because they're pulling data through the gateway


205
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:40,340
and publishing CIDs and then pulling data that way.


206
00:21:43,980 --> 00:21:45,140
I'm not sure I have a question there,


207
00:21:45,140 --> 00:21:47,660
other than I'm thinking about how to apply the system


208
00:21:47,660 --> 00:21:50,020
to where you don't have that strong relationship


209
00:21:50,020 --> 00:21:53,820
between that user base and the draw


210
00:21:53,820 --> 00:21:55,940
and the people who are investing in that.


211
00:21:55,940 --> 00:21:58,940
In our situation, clearly there's one major funder


212
00:21:58,940 --> 00:22:00,740
organization for a lot of it.


213
00:22:00,740 --> 00:22:02,060
But how do we get to that?


214
00:22:02,060 --> 00:22:03,940
I'm thinking a lot about that transition to a world


215
00:22:03,940 --> 00:22:06,860
where the funding of IPFS is more directly tied


216
00:22:06,860 --> 00:22:09,780
to its biggest users and how that might use


217
00:22:09,780 --> 00:22:11,680
some of these tools.


218
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:14,380
I think that grants are also relatively opaque


219
00:22:14,380 --> 00:22:17,660
and are run by someone and it comes from the central,


220
00:22:17,660 --> 00:22:20,180
it doesn't matter what it is or what other web for you


221
00:22:20,180 --> 00:22:21,140
or whatever.


222
00:22:21,140 --> 00:22:26,140
And with this, to me this is like it's all out in the open.


223
00:22:26,940 --> 00:22:28,340
You can see what the dollars are.


224
00:22:28,340 --> 00:22:29,220
It's all there.


225
00:22:29,220 --> 00:22:32,740
And there's these two parts.


226
00:22:32,740 --> 00:22:35,900
There's this invitation to have agency and be like,


227
00:22:35,900 --> 00:22:38,940
I'm in for five bucks a month, right, as an individual.


228
00:22:38,940 --> 00:22:42,700
As an organization, I would start looking around


229
00:22:42,700 --> 00:22:46,260
at organizations, stakeholders who use some of these things


230
00:22:46,260 --> 00:22:51,260
and be like, why is your logo not on this page


231
00:22:52,780 --> 00:22:54,020
for $500 a month?


232
00:22:54,020 --> 00:22:56,220
And the network goods team is looking at some of this stuff


233
00:22:56,220 --> 00:22:59,220
with hyper certs and I'm like, cool, you can figure out


234
00:22:59,220 --> 00:23:00,060
your magic open certs.


235
00:23:00,060 --> 00:23:02,540
I think we can start prototyping this now.


236
00:23:03,500 --> 00:23:07,100
And I think that in fact we can turn that classic loop


237
00:23:07,100 --> 00:23:10,540
of almost like passing the hat, but passing the hat


238
00:23:10,540 --> 00:23:13,300
at the corporate level where it's 100 bucks a month


239
00:23:13,300 --> 00:23:14,900
or 500 bucks a month where you're like,


240
00:23:14,900 --> 00:23:17,940
well, that actually adds up pretty quickly.


241
00:23:18,860 --> 00:23:21,780
So I think that's some of the other dynamic of like,


242
00:23:21,780 --> 00:23:24,780
of course, if you don't literally put it out there


243
00:23:24,780 --> 00:23:28,780
and show like this is, there's not a tiny magic gnome


244
00:23:28,780 --> 00:23:31,500
we've got trapped in GitHub doing your issues for you,


245
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:33,140
right, going like, oh, that's really great


246
00:23:33,140 --> 00:23:33,980
that you've come up.


247
00:23:33,980 --> 00:23:35,300
Are you a contributor?


248
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:39,260
And I think that's where some of my thinking is these days


249
00:23:39,260 --> 00:23:40,540
in thinking about open source licensing.


250
00:23:40,540 --> 00:23:42,180
This is a whole other thing.


251
00:23:42,180 --> 00:23:43,020
I'm not sure.


252
00:23:44,780 --> 00:23:47,620
Various people have thought that we should tinker


253
00:23:47,620 --> 00:23:49,020
with open source licenses.


254
00:23:49,020 --> 00:23:51,620
There's a whole class of thing called fair licenses


255
00:23:51,620 --> 00:23:53,780
where like, oh, if you make money,


256
00:23:53,780 --> 00:23:55,460
you have to buy a license.


257
00:23:55,460 --> 00:23:58,460
What's being asked is to run that open source product,


258
00:23:58,460 --> 00:24:00,260
but that's a business.


259
00:24:00,260 --> 00:24:02,740
That may be a business model and that's totally great.


260
00:24:02,740 --> 00:24:05,780
I'd like to explore the solution space that is like,


261
00:24:05,780 --> 00:24:08,020
oh yeah, we actually won't look at your issue


262
00:24:08,020 --> 00:24:12,900
or answer your support questions


263
00:24:12,900 --> 00:24:14,900
other than in a broad community bucket


264
00:24:14,900 --> 00:24:19,140
that kind of comes last, unless you're a contributor, right?


265
00:24:19,140 --> 00:24:20,820
Everybody gets the code for free.


266
00:24:20,820 --> 00:24:25,820
The scarce resources that is the humans is in fact gated


267
00:24:27,980 --> 00:24:30,220
by like, yeah, you have to be a contributor,


268
00:24:30,220 --> 00:24:31,340
not just cash.


269
00:24:31,340 --> 00:24:32,900
Oh, you did some documentation.


270
00:24:32,900 --> 00:24:34,660
Amazing, you're a contributor.


271
00:24:34,660 --> 00:24:40,660
We're happy to help.


272
00:24:40,660 --> 00:24:42,780
Plus a thousand to that.


273
00:24:42,780 --> 00:24:44,740
One of the biggest challenges that I think,


274
00:24:44,740 --> 00:24:46,780
and I think one of the ways that we've been thinking


275
00:24:46,780 --> 00:24:50,180
about closing the gap in this specific challenge


276
00:24:50,180 --> 00:24:54,540
in IPFS implementations over time is something that,


277
00:24:54,540 --> 00:24:56,180
you know, we've talked about a bunch of times


278
00:24:56,180 --> 00:25:01,180
in this specific event and how the barrier to entry


279
00:25:01,660 --> 00:25:04,260
and being a part of the decision-making entity


280
00:25:04,260 --> 00:25:06,540
around how the protocol actually functions


281
00:25:06,540 --> 00:25:11,540
and is implemented and run at scale is so high


282
00:25:11,540 --> 00:25:14,780
that the users with the most needs


283
00:25:14,780 --> 00:25:16,500
are locked out of that process.


284
00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:19,500
And even the ones that are sufficiently technical


285
00:25:19,500 --> 00:25:20,940
and can at least be like,


286
00:25:20,940 --> 00:25:22,900
I think that needs to change over there.


287
00:25:22,900 --> 00:25:26,500
Like Fishit, for example, is very difficult to cross,


288
00:25:26,500 --> 00:25:28,540
to transition from that to actually being able


289
00:25:28,540 --> 00:25:30,220
to participate in making the change.


290
00:25:30,220 --> 00:25:33,780
And if you can run your open source community


291
00:25:33,780 --> 00:25:35,500
in the way that you just described,


292
00:25:35,500 --> 00:25:38,900
where people that need changes


293
00:25:38,900 --> 00:25:41,460
must participate in the making of them,


294
00:25:42,340 --> 00:25:44,220
you might end up in that world,


295
00:25:44,220 --> 00:25:46,820
but you also face that barrier to entry challenge


296
00:25:46,820 --> 00:25:49,420
if the project isn't starting from scratch.


297
00:25:49,420 --> 00:25:50,780
For projects in motion,


298
00:25:50,780 --> 00:25:52,620
and they've been around for already,


299
00:25:52,620 --> 00:25:54,340
almost a decade at this point,


300
00:25:55,940 --> 00:25:57,860
it's a little harder and you do have to invest


301
00:25:57,860 --> 00:25:59,300
in reducing those barriers.


302
00:25:59,300 --> 00:26:00,740
And I think that actually says something


303
00:26:00,740 --> 00:26:05,700
about your open source projects, culture and values as well,


304
00:26:05,700 --> 00:26:07,580
is the investment and how high or low


305
00:26:07,580 --> 00:26:10,100
those barriers to entry are for your users


306
00:26:10,100 --> 00:26:13,700
to be part of that maker community, I guess.


307
00:26:13,700 --> 00:26:15,180
Yeah, exactly.


308
00:26:16,900 --> 00:26:20,100
Continued topic, I'd love to do more about this.


309
00:26:20,100 --> 00:26:22,700
This is like intent to ship experiment


310
00:26:23,740 --> 00:26:25,460
and sounds like Molly was a plus one


311
00:26:25,460 --> 00:26:27,100
on let's try it with star maps.


312
00:26:28,020 --> 00:26:29,580
And it would be amazing to find


313
00:26:29,580 --> 00:26:32,580
two or three other projects that might be a good fit


314
00:26:33,420 --> 00:26:36,020
for this and really just like run some experiments.


315
00:26:36,940 --> 00:26:39,940
Maybe we can get some of them prepped and up and running


316
00:26:39,940 --> 00:26:43,700
and ahead of IPFS camp


317
00:26:43,700 --> 00:26:45,660
and use that as an in-person thing


318
00:26:45,660 --> 00:26:47,260
to onboard a bunch of people.


319
00:26:47,260 --> 00:26:49,900
Have a bunch of those like $50 tier ones


320
00:26:49,900 --> 00:26:52,540
to get everyone used to using that kind of thing in person.


321
00:26:52,540 --> 00:26:53,380
You in?


322
00:26:54,500 --> 00:26:57,900
I have like 10 more questions to ask you.


323
00:26:57,900 --> 00:27:00,060
Yeah, let's catch up later.


324
00:27:00,060 --> 00:27:00,900
I wanna make time for that.


325
00:27:00,900 --> 00:27:01,900
Thank you very much.


326
00:27:01,900 --> 00:27:26,900
Thank you.
