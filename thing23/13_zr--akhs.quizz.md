## List all the products, tools, and companies discussed

- Bitswap: original IPFS data transfer protocol, moves blocks over libp2p, not well-liked
- Graphsync: second protocol in IPFS, moves entire DAGs, widely used in Filecoin retrieval, also not well-liked
- Multi-party data transfer: Downloading content from many sources at once, enabled by content addressing in IPFS
- Incremental Verifiability: Verifying the data we get as we transfer it incrementally
- Shared data model: The protocol's assumption about what both sides know about the data being transferred
- HTTP: Some participants consider using HTTP for moving data quickly in a content-addressed context
- Multi-protocol clients: Clients that can speak more than one data transfer protocol to get data
- IPFS Thing: A gathering acknowledging the need for improvements in how things are built regarding data transfer
- Move the Bytes working group: Started meeting biweekly in November 2022 to improve data transfer (focused on replacing Bitswap in 4 months)
- Number Zero: Attempted a complete ground-up rewrite of IPFS to tackle data transfer more fundamentally
- IRO: Will be discussed in the next talk by Rudiger; a new data transfer approach

## List all the weak signals of things an almighty AI could do to improve the presenter's life

- Streamlining data transfer protocols: improvements on handling server-side tasks, such as resource consumption minimization and response to malicious clients
- Developing a more suitable protocol for IPFS data transfer: as both Bitswap and Graphsync are criticized, a better solution might be necessary
- Enhancing multi-protocol clients: empowering clients to make better choices based on various protocols available

## List all the weak signals of things that are already great in the presenter's life

- Content addressing in IPFS: enabling multi-party data transfer
- The formation of different working groups and events (IPFS Thing, Move the Bytes working group) acknowledging the need for improvements and working towards enhancing data transfer in IPFS
- Interest in incorporating HTTP and other existing technologies to improve data transfer
- Development of IRO (to be discussed by Rudiger) that might bring a new and promising approach to data transfer
