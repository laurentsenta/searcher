## Overview

In this video, Robin Berjon introduces the Decentralized Data Compliance Working Group, which aims to address compliance challenges in decentralized systems. The working group is open to anyone interested and is primarily focused on finding solutions to problems introduced by decentralization of classic issues like privacy compliance, copyright takedown, and more.

## Decentralized Data Compliance Working Group

The Decentralized Data Compliance Working Group is focused on finding solutions to problems that emerge once you introduce decentralization into typical compliance issues. Examples of these issues include:

- If someone starts storing personal data on IPFS and people replicate that content, who is the data controller?
- What kind of encryption and controls might you need to have around it?
- What kind of GDPR obligations or CPRA obligations?
- Handling copyright takedown notices when using public gateways
- Addressing concerns with CSAM (Child Sexual Abuse Material) and terrorist content

The working group aims to develop an overview of these issues and produce recommendations for address them. They also plan to reach out to people and organizations that have faced these issues to get their input.

## Key Goals and Next Steps

1. Perform anti-user research: Figuring out ways to make it painful to misuse things.
2. Build an overview of the problem space: Chunking it down into smaller issues to fix and advocate for.
3. Create shared legal notices and best practices: Making it easy for operators to comply with regulations and industry standards.
4. Potentially create an industry self-regulation process under GDPR: Creating an agreed set of solutions and enforcement mechanisms.
