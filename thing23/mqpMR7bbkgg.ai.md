## Overview

In this video, achingbrain provides an overview of Helia - a new implementation of IPFS written entirely in JavaScript. Helia aims to apply the learnings gathered over the last few years to create a new implementation that is smaller, more composable and more observable, with redesigned top-level APIs for better usability in various environments including Node, browsers, Electron and Deno.

Alex, also known as achingbrain, works on the IP Stewards team at Protocol Labs, and in this video, he talks about Helia - a new implementation of IPFS all written in JavaScript. Aiming to apply learnings gathered in the last few years, Helia seeks to be smaller and more composable with new top-level APIs that are more ergonomic and usable.

While Helia shares many of the lower level components with existing JSIPFS, such as libp2p, bitswap, and UnixFS, the top level APIs have been completely redesigned. The goal is to make it more usable to integrate IPFS with different applications. This redesign also aims to make Helia more observable by enabling people to dig deep into it and get a better understanding of how it works when something isn't working correctly.

Helia focuses on usability by being smaller and more composable, which allows for better alignment between the different components. This helps to ensure better functionality and faster progress.

Helia targets different environments, including Node, browsers, Electron, and hopefully Deno. The team behind Helia is interested in gathering as much feedback as possible, so they ask that people open issues and contact them to share their use cases and problems.

If you want to learn more about Helia, you can attend Alex's presentations on the IPFS on the web track. The first talk, "Hello Helia," is scheduled to start at 1:30 pm, and the second talk, which covers performance considerations, is scheduled for 2 pm.
