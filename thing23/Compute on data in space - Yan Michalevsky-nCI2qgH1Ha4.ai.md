# Overview

In this video, Yan Michalevsky, one of the founders of Cryptosat, talks about the concept of "compute on data in space." Cryptosat is a company that builds trust infrastructure for Web3 in space by launching, building and integrating satellites into low Earth orbits. The talk focuses on the confidential computing aspect of Cryptosat's work and its integrations with Protocol Labs specific projects. Michalevsky discusses how the lack of physical access and the ability to compromise anything in memory is crucial in building a trusted execution environment. The talk also touches on the growing market of decentralized cloud computing and how it can benefit from a trusted execution environment in space. Michalevsky explains that providing confidentiality and integrity for sensitive workloads is vital, and attestation is a way to provide cryptographic assurance. Cryptosat's tweet from space campaign is introduced at the end of the video.

# CryptoSat's Mission

Cryptosat's main mission is to build the trust infrastructure for Web3 in space. The company achieves this by launching, building, integrating, and launching satellites into low Earth orbits for Web3 use cases, cryptographic protocols, and confidential computing. The company provides a trusted execution environment that is physically isolated and cannot be compromised, and it is this aspect that Michalevsky focuses on in his talk.

# Confidential Computing

Michalevsky discusses how Cryptosat's work is beneficial to the growing market of decentralized cloud computing. Confidentiality and integrity for sensitive workloads are crucial, and Cryptosat provides a trusted execution environment that is physically isolated. Michalevsky mentions homomorphic and fully homomorphic encryption as potential ways to achieve confidentiality, while SNARKs and ZKSNARKs can maintain the privacy of the input for integrity.

# Trusted Execution Environment in Space

Cryptosat proposes the idea of having its satellites or a constellation of satellites provide executors in space. Ground compute gateways can bid on sensitive workloads, and users can indicate that they want workloads to run in a physically isolated environment. The workload is then sent to the satellite, the compute is done there, and the results are returned to the user with attestation that it all happened on an authentic Cryptosat satellite. The company provides a key generation ceremony to achieve attestation, where private keys never leave the satellite, and public keys are broadcasted for verification and signing.

# Conclusion

In conclusion, Yan Michalevsky's talk on compute on data in space shows how Cryptosat is building the trust infrastructure for Web3 in space. The company provides a trusted execution environment that is physically isolated, ensures confidentiality and integrity for sensitive workloads and has attestation as a way to provide cryptographic assurance. Cryptosat's integrations with Protocol Labs-specific projects and its tweet from space campaign add value to the company's work.
