## List all the weak signals of things an almighty AI could do to improve the presenter's life

- Distributed universal database for data analytics: A database where everyone can share data into it, and queries can be distributed across a "computation universe."
- Distributed block store: A block store that scales and goes fast and big, reducing the need for basic KB stores.
- Replication strategies and database classification: classifying the possible databases in the IPFS immutable IPLD realm into different types and finding the best replication strategy for them.
- B-trees in the advanced data layouts: this would help in indexing data within IPFS more efficiently.
- Collaborative indexing: building a shared index collectively, allowing different search algorithms to run.
