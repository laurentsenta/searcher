## Overview

In this video, Ryan Plauche gives an introduction to the Integrating IPFS track, explaining the unique combination of talks and presenters for the event, and the schedule.

## Introduction to the Track

Welcome to the integrating IPFS track! This track is a grab bag of different talks that didn't quite fit into other tracks or is a combination of smaller tracks. The schedule for today is as follows:

1. **Are We Interplanetary Yet?** - Ryan Plauche
2. **DURN: IPFS on Mobile** - David
3. **Decentralizing Auth and UCAN, Too** - Brooklyn
4. Lunch Break
5. **UCAN Workshop** - Arakli (slated for 90 minutes, but will take as much time as needed)
6. **IPVM Talk** - Brooklyn

In a nutshell, this track can be considered the Brooklyn and other people show, as she will be presenting multiple talks throughout the event.
