## Overview

In this video, David Drogansky, an engineering manager on the Bedrock team at Protocol Labs, discusses retrieval compatibility in the Interplanetary Network, composed of IPFS and Filecoin. He goes over the challenges of making IPFS and Filecoin nodes seamlessly send and receive data, and presents the solutions developed by the Bedrock team to increase compatibility and network usability.

## Content

### Terminology

- **Interplanetary Network**: Comprised of IPFS (a peer-to-peer system) and Filecoin (built on blockchain technology for guaranteed data storage and retrieval).
- **Bedrock team**: Works on making data storage, discovery, and retrieval in the Interplanetary Network more performant and reliable.

### Retrieval Compatibility

- **Definition**: Data clients and providers should be agnostic to the underlying platforms and protocols to send and receive data seamlessly.
- **Importance**: Making retrieval easier boosts network usage and growth while providing value for developers and users.

### Improving Compatibility

1. **Interplanetary Network Indexer (IPNI)**: Allows publishers to post content and metadata so that clients can look up the CID to find providers and supported protocols.
2. **Booster BitSwap**: An extension of the Boost storage provider software, enabling it to serve content on Filecoin via BitSwap for direct IPFS node access.
3. **LASI**: A multi-protocol client that abstracts away the process of retrieving data from IPFS and Filecoin, making it easier to develop applications on the network.

### Achievements and Challenges

- Retrieval compatibility is closer with IPNI, Booster BitSwap, and LASI.
- These tools improve network interoperability and ease of use.
- Challenges remain in increasing adoption, performance, reliability, and extending capabilities of Boost and LASI.

## Key Takeaways

- Retrieval compatibility in the Interplanetary Network is essential for boosting network usage, growth, and value.
- The Bedrock team has developed tools such as IPNI, Booster BitSwap, and LASI to improve compatibility and ease of use.
- More work is needed to increase adoption and performance, but the achievements so far demonstrate the potential of increased compatibility in the network.
