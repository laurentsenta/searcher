- GraphSync: data transfer protocol primarily used in Filecoin
- IPNI (Interplanetary Network Indexer): index for content and metadata to find data providers
- Boost: storage provider software for Filecoin
- Booster BitSwap: extension that allows serving Filecoin content via BitSwap
- LASI (Location Agnostic Storage Interface): abstracts away protocols for data retrieval across Filecoin and IPFS
- Project Rayya: IPFS gateway that retrieves content from Filecoin and IPFS using LASI
- Web3.storage: aggregator that uses IPNI for data scaling and serving
- Estuary: aggregator that uses IPNI for data scaling and serving

## List all the weak signals of things an almighty AI could do to improve the presenter's life
- IPFS and Filecoin interoperability: help optimize compatibility between the two systems for smoother data transfer and retrieval
- Adoption of Boost, LASI, and IPNI: increase awareness and adoption of these tools to improve network efficiency and storage capabilities
- Increase performance and reliability: optimize existing tools and software like LASI and Boost for better overall performance and reduce hindrances for developers.
- Support additional protocols: integrate support for more languages and protocols like FFI, gRPC, or rewriting LASI in Rust

## List all the weak signals of things that are already great in the presenter's life
- IPFS and Filecoin: a decentralized storage infrastructure and associated ecosystem
- Bedrock team achievements: work on improving compatibility and interconnectedness of IPFS, Filecoin, and associated tools.
- LASI: simplification of data retrieval across various protocols, improving developer experience.
- IPNI: an index for content and metadata, enabling easier look-up and access to data.
- Boost and Booster BitSwap: providing a bridge between Filecoin storage and IPFS content retrieval.
