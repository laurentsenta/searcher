## Overview

Lajdel, a member of IPFS2 at Protocol Labs, presents a year in review of specification IPIPs. The Interplanetary Improvement Proposal (IPIP) process was announced last year to the community, providing an opening for revising, improving or writing a specification. Lajdel's talk will discuss the highlights of the IPIPs that happened in between the announcement and the current date.

Lajdel's speech was quick-paced and touched on various improvements made in the IPIP process throughout the year. The most notable highlights are the design of a project board by which to track the lifecycle of IPIPs, an ad hoc group of spec stewards who manage concerns related to long term possibility of supporting specs across implementations, the shipping of gateway specs for files and redirects, support for fetching bigger directory trees as a tar stream, and building verification within the IPFS ecosystem.

Lajdel emphasized the importance of a simple language when constructing software specs in order to create a community memory and promote understanding. Additionally, Lajdel mentioned that currently, the IPFS implementers working group holds biweekly calls to discuss specs and proposals.

Throughout the speech, Lajdel encouraged the community to participate by writing and improving specs or by reviewing and testing them. Lajdel also highlighted the importance of test fixtures, which cover all the edge cases of specs, as a means of building confidence among the community, promoting ease of understanding, and raising the quality of the spec process.
