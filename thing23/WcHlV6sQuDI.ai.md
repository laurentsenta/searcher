## Overview

In this video, Lijdel from Protocol Labs reviews the progress made in Interplanetary Improvement Proposals (IPIPs) during the last year, focusing on communication and the achievements in implementing new features in IPFS. He covers various IPIPs related to gateway specifications, denial lists, delegated routing, and other improvements necessary for the IPFS ecosystem.

## IPIPs in Review

IPIPs are a four-letter acronym for Interplanetary Improvement Proposal. These proposals allow the community to suggest improvements or changes to specifications and discuss them in a structured manner.

The IPIP process has resulted in the implementation of many features, including gateway-related features, denial lists, delegated routing, and other improvements necessary for the IPFS ecosystem. Lijdel gives an overview of these changes, some of which have been ratified and implemented, and others that are still in progress or have been rejected.

### Highlights of Implemented IPIPs

- Gateway Redirects File was community-driven and enables slow shifting of website hosting to gateways.
- Ability to fetch larger directory trees as a serialized TAR stream.
- DAG C-BOR and DAG JSON representation of IPLD data models.
- IPNS Signature and DNS over HTTPS.
- Graph API for partial car export, allowing for more efficient light clients.

### On-Going IPIPs

- Bad Bits and Deny lists are being proposed and discussed by the community, with various organizations potentially building their lists using the same format.
- Delegated routing, including content, peer, and HTTP/IPFS routing for improved efficiency.
- Improve IPFS DHT specification and introduce double hashing DHT for better privacy.
- Improve UnixFS and gateway interaction, data onboarding with HTTP post, and the indexer story.

### Engaging with the IPIP Process

Lijdel encourages community members to engage with the IPIP process, either by writing specs or suggesting improvements. All feedback helps improve the current ecosystem and makes the specs sounder and more comprehensive in their language.

## Key Takeaways

- IPIPs have significantly contributed to the IPFS ecosystem, improving gateway specifications, denial lists, delegated routing, and other areas.
- The community-driven IPIP process has enabled extensive discussions and collaboration, leading to better development and implementation of features.
- Community involvement in the IPIP process, whether it is through suggesting improvements, writing specs or proofreading existing ones, is essential to the continued growth and development of the IPFS ecosystem.
