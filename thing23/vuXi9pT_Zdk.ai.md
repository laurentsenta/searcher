## Overview

In this video, Steve Loeppky introduces [Kubo](https://github.com/kubograf/kubo), an implementation of IPFS. Kubo is best suited for independent self-hosters, and powers marquee use cases in onboarding for the IPFS community, like Brave browser, HTTP gateways, and IPFS desktop. The video highlights Kubo's accomplishments, upcoming updates, and the team behind it, along with a call for feedback and collaboration.

### Introduction

Kubo is IPFS's first implementation and has grown with the IPFS project. It is versatile and has been used to meet various needs. However, Steve believes Kubo is best suited for the independent self-hoster, as shown in the new logo featuring a camper. Kubo powers marquee use cases in onboarding for the IPFS community, including:

- Brave browser
- HTTP gateways
- IPFS desktop

### Accomplishments

Since the last gathering in Iceland, the team has achieved the following:

- Implementing the HT routing V1 API, enabling query parallelism in Kubo with CID.contact.
- Soft launch of [Boxo](https://github.com/kubograf/boxo), a library of reusable Kubo functionality.
- Wrangling the Golub P2P resource manager into Kubo, adding resource accounting.
- Steady improvements to the gateway, particularly around verifiability with IPNS records.

### Upcoming Updates

The following updates are planned for Q1:

- Update content routing within Kubo with reader privacy on both DHT and network indexer fronts.
- Improvements around routing table resiliency, providing operations guidance, and enhancing BitSwap with metrics, timeouts, and backpressure.
- Pushing to test and validate the hypothesis around Boxo.
- Introducing configurability of data transfer protocols within Kubo.

### Team and Collaboration

A special thanks to the core maintainers of Kubo and over 350 direct contributors. The maintainers are eager to connect and collaborate with others in the IPFS ecosystem. Please share use cases and feedback with them, and contribute to the ongoing development of Kubo.
