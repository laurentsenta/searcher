## Overview

In this video, Alex Kinstler introduces Saturn, a decentralized Content Delivery Network (CDN) that accelerates retrievals from IPFS and Filecoin. He explains the core problems Saturn aims to solve, its commercial viability, and illustrates a browser retrieval use case with a service worker example. Saturn reached over 2000 nodes in this presentation.

## Background and Problem Solving

Saturn aims to solve two core problems:

1. Most traffic and retrievals from IPFS go through public centralized gateways, which cannot match the speed required by modern DApps and large-scale applications in Web3.
2. There is no cache and acceleration layer for Filecoin, causing Filecoin retrievals to be slower than ideal.

Building a CDN for Web3 is commercially viable, as the global CDN market is expected to be twice as large as the cloud object storage market.

## Saturn and its Commercial Viability

Saturn is a decentralized CDN that supports retrievals from Filecoin and IPFS. Some of its target verticals include storage providers, NFT projects, blockchains, video projects, game studios, and DApp developers. The first client of Saturn is IPFS.io.

## Browser Retrievals Use Case

Alex Kinstler demonstrated a browser retrieval use case through a service worker implementation. He illustrated setting up the service worker and showed how it could be used to instantly access the HLS video stream.

## Future Outlook

The following are the future plans for Saturn:

- Stabilizing sub-second time to first byte performance for P95 (achieved last month)
- Launching a beta test program for Saturn customers by the end of the month
- Releasing decentralized payouts with smart contracts on FVM next month
- Achieving 100% of traffic from RIA through Saturn by the end of the quarter, resulting in improved performance, correctness, and latency

In summary, Saturn is a significant breakthrough in the Web3 space, providing fast content retrieval and paving the way for improved performance across various Web3 applications.
