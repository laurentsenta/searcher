# Overview
In his talk, "Are We Interplanetary Yet? Designing IPFS for Space," Ryan Plauche discusses the challenges of implementing IPFS in space to create an interplanetary file system. He introduces MySelli as a new implementation of IPFS, specifically designed as a building block for deploying IPFS into space. He highlights how IPFS in space cannot be the same as cloud server's IPFS due to the hardware constraints of satellites and the specific details of space equipment. Ryan mentions his goal of giving developers a platform to iterate on better data transfer protocols or solving the peer-to-peer problem in space without worrying about the hardware constraints of satellites. Lastly, he states that the software will be running in a satellite in an orbit near in the future and mentions the demonstration mission, which includes transmitting data from a single satellite to a single ground station, shipping blocks back and forth, and seeing those blocks go from satellite to ground station to Qubo to the broader public IPFS network.

# IPFS in Space; MySelli Implementation - Ryan Plauche

In his talk, "Are We Interplanetary Yet? Designing IPFS for Space," Ryan Plauche talks about the development of MySelli as a new implementation of IPFS that will enable the creation of an interplanetary file system. Ryan works with Little Bear Labs, and he was volunteered to attempt to answer this question of whether or not we are interplanetary yet. He does not promise anything that he cannot deliver and does not give a straight answer to the question. Instead, he talks about what they are currently doing and emphasizes the need to consider hardware constraints and specific details when implementing IPFS in space.

According to Ryan, MySelli is more of a building block for deploying IPFS into space. He highlights that IPFS in space cannot be your typical cloud server's IPFS. It will not work well on satellites with unreliable connections. Ryan acknowledges the need to go back to first principles when implementing IPFS in space and appreciates the flexibility that comes with being able to reimagine what these implementations can do.

Ryan's goal with MySelli is to give developers a platform to iterate on better data transfer protocols, solve peer-to-peer problems in space, and think about how the protocol would work in space. He understands that hardware specificity and constraints exist, but MySelli aims to use network layers as an abstraction to push away those specifics.

Ryan goes on to discuss the plan for implementing IPFS in space in the near future, stating that the software will be running in a satellite in an orbit near us soon. He expresses his excitement about the demonstration mission, where data will be transmitted from a single satellite to a single ground station. They will see the blocks go from satellite to ground station to Qubo, and eventually, to the broader public IPFS network. Ryan believes that the successful integration of space to the public IPFS network is the gold standard they are reaching for in terms of demos.

In conclusion, Ryan's talk highlights the challenges of implementing IPFS in space and introduces MySelli as a new implementation of IPFS that will enable the creation of an interplanetary file system. He embraces the need to go back to first principles when implementing IPFS in space and provides a platform for developers to iterate on better data transfer protocols, solve peer-to-peer problems in space, and think about how the protocol would work in space. Ryan believes that the successful integration of space to the public IPFS network is the gold standard they are reaching for in terms of demos.
