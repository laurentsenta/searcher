1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,040
I actually changed the title of this talk because we're not announcing the blog today.


2
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:11,060
It's still in flux and I actually got some updates with Dietrich yesterday.


3
00:00:11,060 --> 00:00:12,060
We went through it.


4
00:00:12,060 --> 00:00:15,180
V2 is sitting on that notepad right there.


5
00:00:15,180 --> 00:00:19,980
So I'm going to go ahead and walk through our V1 of the talk and then some of the ideas


6
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:21,780
we're coming out with after that.


7
00:00:21,780 --> 00:00:25,800
So that's why the talk title is a little bit different here.


8
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:31,160
So as you saw this morning in Dietrich's opening talk, we work on a lot of different stuff


9
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:34,940
in a lot of different places and we need a place to rapidly communicate that work.


10
00:00:34,940 --> 00:00:38,060
We don't always want to push every single thing to the IPFS blog.


11
00:00:38,060 --> 00:00:39,720
It might not be appropriate there.


12
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:41,640
We want to communicate really rapidly.


13
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:43,500
That's why we need a team blog.


14
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:48,200
On top of that, we want to dog food the IPFS, FVM, any like related technologies that we


15
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:50,560
want to just work with it day to day.


16
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:54,500
So we can improve our understanding and then, you know, just see if we can make the tools


17
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:56,540
better, of course.


18
00:00:56,540 --> 00:01:01,600
We also wanted to enable builders to use these tools that are available now.


19
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:06,840
And maybe we can use this blog to come up with patterns that we can build for other


20
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:10,020
users to build for end users.


21
00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:13,340
So why didn't we just use a regular blog?


22
00:01:13,340 --> 00:01:15,260
We wanted something that's censorship resistant.


23
00:01:15,260 --> 00:01:19,740
Not really a problem for us specifically, but in general, that's a, you know, good thing


24
00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:22,080
for decentralized publishing.


25
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:23,380
We want content ownership.


26
00:01:23,380 --> 00:01:26,500
We want verifiable authorship.


27
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:30,700
Verifiable content with the CIDs, right, since we're publishing on IPFS.


28
00:01:30,700 --> 00:01:32,960
And we want resilience to platform instability.


29
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:36,660
And we want user agency for the end users who are going to be consuming this information.


30
00:01:36,660 --> 00:01:39,880
So how's the blog built?


31
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:45,420
So version one, we have basically a viewer, which is a single page app.


32
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:49,800
And then we have a smart contract, which is currently only holding two arrays.


33
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:55,360
It's a list of the blog CIDs, which is just markdown files, and then a list of the authors


34
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:58,080
who can actually push to that smart contract.


35
00:01:58,080 --> 00:02:01,940
And then finally, we have a publishing tool, which is currently just a CLI that all it


36
00:02:01,940 --> 00:02:04,620
does is just interacts with that smart contract.


37
00:02:04,620 --> 00:02:10,900
Basically you upload your markdown file to IPFS, you get the CID back, you pass that


38
00:02:10,900 --> 00:02:14,980
into the CLI tool, and that'll go ahead and update that smart contract.


39
00:02:14,980 --> 00:02:18,660
This kind of just goes over the viewer again.


40
00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:21,780
One of the cool things about the viewer is we have all this information, right?


41
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:24,940
We have the transaction hash, we have the wallet info, and we have the CIDs.


42
00:02:24,940 --> 00:02:31,980
So we can display all that for the users so they can themselves go and verify this.


43
00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:35,100
We also are currently storing this stuff in local storage.


44
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:41,300
So we want this to be, the end version of this, to be offline-friendly so that people


45
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:42,300
can pull it up.


46
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:44,300
If they're offline, they can still view all the stuff.


47
00:02:44,300 --> 00:02:50,060
And then once they get online, they can sync and get the newest posts.


48
00:02:50,060 --> 00:02:51,140
Contract same thing.


49
00:02:51,140 --> 00:02:54,300
List of post CIDs, list of authors.


50
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:59,500
One of the reasons we wanted to go with the contract initially was that we could separate


51
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:01,140
all these CIDs and everything.


52
00:03:01,140 --> 00:03:05,540
Instead of doing just a statically generated blog where all the data's living in that


53
00:03:05,540 --> 00:03:10,540
and being pushed around IPFS, I thought it'd be interesting to have it available to maybe


54
00:03:10,540 --> 00:03:15,220
data aggregators, people who want to pull this stuff in, make it searchable, or back


55
00:03:15,220 --> 00:03:16,220
to the user agency.


56
00:03:16,220 --> 00:03:20,580
If people want to have their own viewers, they can just pull this content down with


57
00:03:20,580 --> 00:03:25,340
all the information, who the author is, everything, and view it on their own terms or in their


58
00:03:25,340 --> 00:03:27,060
own read or whatever.


59
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:31,700
We've talked a little bit about doing some decentralized RSS work.


60
00:03:31,700 --> 00:03:36,020
Maybe something we're going to integrate with Durin one of these days, maybe with this blog.


61
00:03:36,020 --> 00:03:41,580
So this was kind of like why we originally went with the contract idea, was that separation


62
00:03:41,580 --> 00:03:42,580
of concerns.


63
00:03:42,580 --> 00:03:49,380
And then the publishing tool mostly covered this, but takes in that CID, super duper simple,


64
00:03:49,380 --> 00:03:52,060
and it just talks to the smart contract.


65
00:03:52,060 --> 00:03:55,860
The next version of this, we want to basically just do everything in browser so that the


66
00:03:55,860 --> 00:04:00,360
authors, the people on our team, can just log in, edit the markdown right there, go


67
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:04,500
ahead and use MetaMask or whatever, maybe the Brave wallet, and just sign that transaction


68
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:08,060
and it automatically updates.


69
00:04:08,060 --> 00:04:13,780
So after looking at this blog, I was thinking, we already have the basic static file hosting,


70
00:04:13,780 --> 00:04:18,340
and if we have the ability to add and edit dynamic content with the smart contract, and


71
00:04:18,340 --> 00:04:23,460
on top of that, in addition to all that, we can add a transparency, verifiability with


72
00:04:23,460 --> 00:04:25,620
the smart contract and all this.


73
00:04:25,620 --> 00:04:26,860
What else could we build with this pattern?


74
00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:31,660
I feel that we could probably replace a lot of Web 2 things right now with this pattern,


75
00:04:31,660 --> 00:04:34,140
if we just kind of get the pattern right.


76
00:04:34,140 --> 00:04:37,740
So that's what we're trying to figure out right now.


77
00:04:37,740 --> 00:04:39,980
We have some improvements that we've been talking about this week.


78
00:04:39,980 --> 00:04:41,660
I'm going to keep hacking on it.


79
00:04:41,660 --> 00:04:43,260
The hack days, I'm definitely going to be working on this.


80
00:04:43,260 --> 00:04:47,900
If you want to talk to me about it, we can definitely do it.


81
00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:51,060
Part of the thing we want to do is we want to remove external dependencies, probably


82
00:04:51,060 --> 00:04:54,180
get rid of the APIs to talk to the smart contract.


83
00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:58,420
I think that we have some interesting ways to pass around configs and just sign that


84
00:04:58,420 --> 00:05:03,260
kind of after the fact so that we don't have to be pulling from this chain directly.


85
00:05:03,260 --> 00:05:08,580
It'll just be there to verify transactions at a later date.


86
00:05:08,580 --> 00:05:12,940
The RSS subscribing, that's an interesting thing we want to check out.


87
00:05:12,940 --> 00:05:18,260
We want to instrument this stuff so that I can get some metrics, see how people are taking


88
00:05:18,260 --> 00:05:19,260
in this pattern.


89
00:05:19,260 --> 00:05:22,060
We're going to keep blogging on it, documenting it.


90
00:05:22,060 --> 00:05:28,620
I'm going to be using the new JavaScript library, IPFS, in this publishing tool to try and bring


91
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:33,580
this all into one piece so we don't have to use that CLI tool.


92
00:05:33,580 --> 00:05:35,500
Again this is a pattern, it's a work in progress.


93
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:38,100
I would love your input, love to chat about it.


94
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:41,660
We're in browsers and platforms on Filecoin Slack.


95
00:05:41,660 --> 00:05:42,780
That is the repo.


96
00:05:42,780 --> 00:05:46,340
If you want to poke around in there or put issues in or tell me why it's not actually


97
00:05:46,340 --> 00:05:49,460
decentralized enough, I'm happy to hear all that stuff.


98
00:05:49,460 --> 00:05:50,460
I'll be at these hack days.


99
00:05:50,460 --> 00:05:51,460
So yeah, come by.


100
00:05:51,460 --> 00:05:52,460
Thank you.


101
00:05:52,460 --> 00:06:04,780
Yeah, is there any questions?


102
00:06:04,780 --> 00:06:07,500
That's a lightning talk.


103
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:09,860
I didn't want to keep you all from the happy hour.


104
00:06:09,860 --> 00:06:18,740
So just to clarify, there's an ETH backend and does that do, just as, wait, you mentioned


105
00:06:18,740 --> 00:06:20,900
there's something with blockchain, or did I imagine that?


106
00:06:20,900 --> 00:06:25,140
Currently there is, and now it's kind of funny, like literally during these talks, like yesterday


107
00:06:25,140 --> 00:06:28,300
and today I was talking to Dietrich and I was like, I think we can kind of cut that


108
00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:29,300
out.


109
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:30,820
But yes, currently there is.


110
00:06:30,820 --> 00:06:36,780
And what's on there right now is a smart contract that stores an array of the CIDs, the post


111
00:06:36,780 --> 00:06:38,780
CIDs, and then an array of the authors.


112
00:06:38,780 --> 00:06:40,580
And that's all that's on there right now.


113
00:06:40,580 --> 00:06:41,580
Yeah.


114
00:06:41,580 --> 00:06:42,580
All right.


115
00:06:42,580 --> 00:06:48,660
I had another question, but then I forgot about it.


116
00:06:48,660 --> 00:06:56,700
Oh, and so, okay, why do something like that over IPNS or just because...


117
00:06:56,700 --> 00:07:00,660
Originally we were saying, well, it seems simpler at the time to just get this thing


118
00:07:00,660 --> 00:07:02,220
going basically.


119
00:07:02,220 --> 00:07:05,500
And we really liked the idea of me and like the contractors working with, we really liked


120
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:07,980
the idea of separating out the data from that.


121
00:07:07,980 --> 00:07:12,860
We were looking at like, are we going to have to regenerate the viewer page, basically like


122
00:07:12,860 --> 00:07:14,540
the viewer page every single time.


123
00:07:14,540 --> 00:07:16,860
And it's every time someone goes to the blog, are they going to have to pull this whole


124
00:07:16,860 --> 00:07:18,100
thing down?


125
00:07:18,100 --> 00:07:22,540
And we kind of liked the idea of like having this offline thing and then just fetching


126
00:07:22,540 --> 00:07:24,700
those posts behind.


127
00:07:24,700 --> 00:07:29,300
But after what we were just talking about, I think we can just put that config on IPFS


128
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:32,540
and then link to it from IPNS and it should be fine.


129
00:07:32,540 --> 00:07:36,620
And then we'll just sign that transaction linking to that CID so that we still have


130
00:07:36,620 --> 00:07:39,260
that like authorship there.


131
00:07:39,260 --> 00:07:44,940
Where that config specifies the SIDS that compose like the posts for the blog?


132
00:07:44,940 --> 00:07:45,940
Correct.


133
00:07:45,940 --> 00:07:47,500
And the authors, but you wouldn't, you know.


134
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:48,500
Yeah.


135
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:52,060
So at some point you have to update a CID somewhere and publish it and verify it.


136
00:07:52,060 --> 00:07:53,060
Yeah.


137
00:07:53,060 --> 00:07:54,060
Yeah.


138
00:07:54,060 --> 00:07:56,540
And that's what you would update is that config instead of the smart contract is what we're


139
00:07:56,540 --> 00:07:57,540
thinking.


140
00:07:57,540 --> 00:07:58,540
Yeah.


141
00:07:58,540 --> 00:07:59,540
Yeah.


142
00:07:59,540 --> 00:08:00,540
Yeah.


143
00:08:00,540 --> 00:08:01,540
Right.


144
00:08:01,540 --> 00:08:07,940
It's less of a question, more of a comment.


145
00:08:07,940 --> 00:08:12,540
I think this is a great demo project for like hackathons and stuff because it uses a lot


146
00:08:12,540 --> 00:08:16,740
of technologies that we like really care about.


147
00:08:16,740 --> 00:08:21,060
And curious if you can at some point also turn this into like a tutorial on how you


148
00:08:21,060 --> 00:08:22,060
build it.


149
00:08:22,060 --> 00:08:24,060
But that's for later.


150
00:08:24,060 --> 00:08:25,060
Yeah.


151
00:08:25,060 --> 00:08:27,460
I think it's still like very, very early in this process.


152
00:08:27,460 --> 00:08:30,580
You know, we kind of just, and it's been sort of like a back burner project.


153
00:08:30,580 --> 00:08:35,500
So but I'm happy to share it now just so I can get like input, you know.


154
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:38,340
But definitely we want to build out these tutorials and I really want to just establish


155
00:08:38,340 --> 00:08:40,540
what's like a couple of different patterns of this.


156
00:08:40,540 --> 00:08:43,900
Because I think that like a lot of the tooling is already here to start building this stuff,


157
00:08:43,900 --> 00:08:47,940
like actually decentralized apps like this in pretty simple ways.


158
00:08:47,940 --> 00:08:50,180
So I just wanted to, yeah, I don't want to build a whole framework.


159
00:08:50,180 --> 00:08:51,180
I don't want to do that.


160
00:08:51,180 --> 00:08:56,860
I just want to put some examples out there and really like establish these patterns.


161
00:08:56,860 --> 00:08:59,100
Can you update it from Durin?


162
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:02,940
Not yet, but eventually that'd be very cool.


163
00:09:02,940 --> 00:09:03,940
Yeah.


164
00:09:03,940 --> 00:09:04,940
Yeah.


165
00:09:04,940 --> 00:09:11,140
I think that'd be a great example of doing that sort of thing like on the fly and thinking


166
00:09:11,140 --> 00:09:15,500
about what might go in the Durin code base to like support that and go back and forth


167
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:21,500
and see if some of us can also like lean into the fact that you have Durin as a specialized


168
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:25,340
client, you know, again, maybe in beta mode or something like that.


169
00:09:25,340 --> 00:09:26,340
Right.


170
00:09:26,340 --> 00:09:31,540
So it would be amazing if you could take advantage of that, like take a picture, go to Durin,


171
00:09:31,540 --> 00:09:37,380
immediately upload it and very simply go like, oh, that goes on the browsers and platforms


172
00:09:37,380 --> 00:09:39,340
photo blog or something like that.


173
00:09:39,340 --> 00:09:40,340
Totally.


174
00:09:40,340 --> 00:09:41,980
I can vote for new features all day long.


175
00:09:41,980 --> 00:09:43,460
I can put that in the issue queue.


176
00:09:43,460 --> 00:09:44,460
Yeah.


177
00:09:44,460 --> 00:09:45,460
Put it in there.


178
00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:46,660
I like as many ideas as I can get.


179
00:09:46,660 --> 00:09:49,020
I love them.


180
00:09:49,020 --> 00:09:54,540
So I think I understand where you're coming from with the offline client as a single page


181
00:09:54,540 --> 00:09:56,700
app that knows how to pull the data structures.


182
00:09:56,700 --> 00:09:57,700
Yeah.


183
00:09:57,700 --> 00:10:01,740
But as a tutorial, like for the mission of telling patterns to people, you might just


184
00:10:01,740 --> 00:10:05,820
blow a bunch of web developers minds if you do like a static site build right then and


185
00:10:05,820 --> 00:10:07,020
have people serve HTML.


186
00:10:07,020 --> 00:10:08,020
Sure.


187
00:10:08,020 --> 00:10:09,020
Sure.


188
00:10:09,020 --> 00:10:10,020
Yeah.


189
00:10:10,020 --> 00:10:12,460
If you're going to do one of the most basic patterns, then we can just keep building off


190
00:10:12,460 --> 00:10:15,460
of that.


191
00:10:15,460 --> 00:10:18,380
Yeah.


192
00:10:18,380 --> 00:10:19,700
Another very basic question.


193
00:10:19,700 --> 00:10:20,700
You may have mentioned this.


194
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:25,540
Where do you publish the SID for the config that describes the blog post?


195
00:10:25,540 --> 00:10:28,060
So that would be, what do you mean publish?


196
00:10:28,060 --> 00:10:34,780
So you have this, the config can detail CIDs, which lists blogs, which you actually use


197
00:10:34,780 --> 00:10:36,220
to pull content.


198
00:10:36,220 --> 00:10:41,540
But how does the user know what is the right config for the current state of the blog?


199
00:10:41,540 --> 00:10:42,740
That would be on IPNS.


200
00:10:42,740 --> 00:10:46,420
So they'll be pulling, they'll check that and then that'll have the most up to date


201
00:10:46,420 --> 00:10:47,420
SID.


202
00:10:47,420 --> 00:10:50,340
And then that config, but with the offline thing, the offline thing was going to like


203
00:10:50,340 --> 00:10:52,700
store that config and then like check that.


204
00:10:52,700 --> 00:10:57,700
But that's now I'm seeing as I'm talking about not super necessary to explain the pattern.


205
00:10:57,700 --> 00:11:01,300
That's just an extra, but yeah, so that's all it is right there.


206
00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:02,980
But maybe we can use the name name service.


207
00:11:02,980 --> 00:11:04,860
Like I have to hear about that today.


208
00:11:04,860 --> 00:11:05,860
That'd be pretty cool.


209
00:11:05,860 --> 00:11:06,860
Yeah.


210
00:11:06,860 --> 00:11:35,860
There you go.
