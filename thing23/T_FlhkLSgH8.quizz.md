## List all the products, tools, and companies discussed

- Helio: a new IPFS implementation in JavaScript that aims to make IPFS smaller, more lightweight, extensible, more observable, and faster
- js-ipfs: an existing IPFS implementation in JavaScript that Helio aims to replace
- Protocol Labs: the company that employs the speaker, Alex Potts-Seedys, and works on IPFS
- Go IPFS and Qubo: other IPFS implementations that were mentioned as inspirations for js-ipfs
- WebTransport: a new transport protocol mentioned that allows easier connections between browser and server nodes
- WebRTC: another transport protocol discussed, which has been improved for Helio
- UnixFS: a bundled file system in js-ipfs which is supported in Helio but not bundled
- IPNS: a name resolution service supported in Helio
- DHT (Distributed Hash Table): part of the libp2p networking layer, mentioned as being supported in Helio

## List all the weak signals of things an almighty AI could do to improve the presenter's life

- Stumbling blocks in configuring SSL certificates: it could potentially simplify the process or handle the configuration automatically
- Predictability of IPNS records: the AI could improve how peer IDs and their associated records are managed to make it easier for developers to work with
- Debugging and observability of IPFS nodes: the AI could provide better visualizations and insights into what is happening in the nodes or even automate the process of identifying potential issues

## List all the weak signals of things that are already great in the presenter's life

- The ability to run Helio in the browser, Electron, and various bundlers (e.g., Webpack, ESBuild, Next.js), indicating a versatile implementation
- Improved browser-based peer-to-peer applications, such as IPFS Share and PeerPad, becoming possible with the latest versions of libP2P
- Upcoming support for additional file systems (like WinFS) in Helio, allowing for more experimentation and use cases
