## Overview

In this video, Adin Schmahmann of Protocol Labs discusses IPFS gateways and how to integrate them into browsers and the web platform using service workers and fetch API.

## Content

Adin Schmahmann has been working on IPFS for over four years and is excited about the potential of incorporating IPFS gateways into browsers and the web platform. He explains the functionalities of gateways, which include finding and fetching content, verifying its correctness, and rendering it in the browser.

The presentation focuses on shifting more of the gateway work to the client side to reduce dependency on service operators and overall expenses. This can be accomplished using service workers and the fetch API in the browser.

Adin demonstrates how this process works with some examples, including loading a video and other content using BitSwap, support for HTTP fetching of data, and experimentation with new protocols and data types.

The presentation concludes with suggestions on how to join the efforts, including trying the demos, reporting experiences, filing PRs and issues, sharing ideas and code, and enabling web transport on IPFS implementations.
