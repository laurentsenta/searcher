1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,320
I'm Yuni and this is Nicole.


2
00:00:05,320 --> 00:00:06,320
Hello.


3
00:00:06,320 --> 00:00:07,320
Hello.


4
00:00:07,320 --> 00:00:08,320
And we are the MIWA team.


5
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:10,520
MIWA stands for Milky Way.


6
00:00:10,520 --> 00:00:15,960
And we had this idea, I don't know, a few months ago to do something called IPFS and


7
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:16,960
Friends Cafe.


8
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:24,680
I think exact name TBD, but oh yes, we do want to make it bigger.


9
00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:30,600
And really the purpose at the time was to tag on to larger events.


10
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:33,480
For example, East Denver.


11
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:37,400
And here you can see where we had our little IPFS and Friends Coffee pop up.


12
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:38,400
Our first one.


13
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:39,400
It was so awesome.


14
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:45,280
So we want to continue to do more.


15
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:51,760
And so we tagged on to the Filecoin Foundation Hacker Base and we were open for, was it just


16
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:52,760
one day?


17
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:54,040
Yeah, we were open for one day.


18
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:57,560
We were open like throughout the morning into the afternoon.


19
00:00:57,560 --> 00:00:58,720
And we were having people come in.


20
00:00:58,720 --> 00:01:03,480
We were introducing ourselves, having them scan this QR code so everyone scan it, kind


21
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:07,080
of get familiar with the link tree and what we're offering.


22
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:11,360
And we were also telling individuals there if they're interested in hosting an event


23
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:16,320
like this, that we would love to collect their information so they could do so in the future.


24
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:21,280
And not just this, like in the link tree we also have pre-registration for IPFS camp,


25
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:25,360
IPFS thing, the community events calendar.


26
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:30,640
And so really it's just to get more information about other people who might be interested


27
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:32,360
in coming or speaking.


28
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:35,920
But this one wasn't, there was no content surrounding this.


29
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:43,440
The idea really is to create like a, I want to say like a workshop or a cafe where we


30
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:48,200
can share ideas and we would be, yeah, collaborate.


31
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:56,000
And we would help a community member create their own cafe so that they can continue to


32
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,380
run it in their own little ecosystem or their community.


33
00:02:00,380 --> 00:02:02,480
And so here's a map of the world.


34
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:06,720
I shared this link in the Slack channel, so feel free to join and we're going to do the


35
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:08,200
little heart game again.


36
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:11,560
If you can put where we should be hosting the community events.


37
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:17,000
We want to know where you think we should be, where we should go next, just unique locations.


38
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:22,920
And maybe if you have a recommendation of who could help host that, that would be great.


39
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:25,840
But I guess the first one can be in Serbia.


40
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:26,840
Yay.


41
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:27,840
Wherever.


42
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:28,840
There you go.


43
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:29,840
Giant, giant heart.


44
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:30,840
The giant heart.


45
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:31,840
Perfect.


46
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:39,840
And let's go ahead and put one in India.


47
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:44,360
Oh.


48
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:45,360
Where are we going in the US?


49
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:47,360
That's a big heart.


50
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:48,360
Yeah.


51
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:49,360
I love it.


52
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:50,360
That's Princeton.


53
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:53,360
There's a regular gathering of blockchain meetings, but they're like very, very narrowly blockchainy.


54
00:02:53,360 --> 00:03:01,360
And I would like to change the minds.


55
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:02,360
Nice.


56
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:03,360
Yeah.


57
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:13,800
So you would be willing to host the cafe there?


58
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:14,800
At least once.


59
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:15,800
Yeah.


60
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:16,800
Okay, cool.


61
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:17,800
Yeah.


62
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:20,280
We just want to offer the resources to everyone and lend a hand.


63
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:21,280
Yeah.


64
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:24,360
South Africa would be amazing.


65
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:25,360
Yes.


66
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:26,360
No Australia.


67
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:27,360
I'll do it.


68
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:28,360
I'll go.


69
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:29,360
Yeah.


70
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:30,360
Do you want it in Utah?


71
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:31,360
Boris, where's your computer?


72
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:32,360
This is the struggle.


73
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:33,360
I don't understand.


74
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:34,360
I don't understand.


75
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:35,360
I don't know.


76
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:36,360
I don't understand.


77
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:37,360
I don't understand.


78
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:38,360
I don't understand.


79
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:39,360
I don't understand.


80
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:40,360
I don't understand.


81
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:41,360
I don't understand.


82
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:42,360
I don't understand.


83
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:43,360
I don't understand.


84
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:44,360
I don't understand.


85
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:45,360
I don't understand.


86
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:46,360
I don't understand.


87
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:47,360
So what are we doing to help you?


88
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:48,360
I'm having trouble.


89
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:49,360
I'm having trouble.


90
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:50,360
Tell us.


91
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:51,360
I don't understand.


92
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:52,360
I don't understand.


93
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:53,360
I don't understand.


94
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:54,360
I don't understand.


95
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:55,360
You can just tell us.


96
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:56,360
Tell us.


97
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:57,360
It's covering all of the possible locations.


98
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:58,360
Amazing.


99
00:03:58,360 --> 00:03:59,360
We got it.


100
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:00,360
Cool.


101
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:01,360
Yeah.


102
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:02,360
So we will have-


103
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:03,360
Copenhagen.


104
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:04,360
Oh, Copenhagen.


105
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:05,360
Yes.


106
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:06,360
Yes.


107
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:07,360
Are you hosting?


108
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:08,360
Oh, amazing.


109
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:09,360
Yay.


110
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:10,360
So cool.


111
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:11,360
Perfect.


112
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:12,360
We love that.


113
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:17,360
I'd say in the beginning, we could offer logistics.


114
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:19,920
It's really catered to your needs.


115
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:25,200
Like if you need logistical support, help securing PL speakers, we could provide you


116
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:26,600
with swag.


117
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:33,800
We can offer some small monies to help you secure a venue or something like that.


118
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:38,860
And then once you guys have done it once or twice, then you can be off into the world


119
00:04:38,860 --> 00:04:40,800
and you know how to run your event.


120
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:44,900
But any kind of advice or anything like that, we can help support you.


121
00:04:44,900 --> 00:04:47,900
Did I forget anything?


122
00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:48,900
No.


123
00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:49,900
I think that's it.


124
00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:50,900
Yay!


125
00:04:50,900 --> 00:04:51,900
Did you want this?


126
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:52,900
Yes.


127
00:04:52,900 --> 00:04:53,900
And you can read this if you want.


128
00:04:53,900 --> 00:05:04,700
So some of the goals of this IPFS Friends Cafe would be to grow the IPFS community events.


129
00:05:04,700 --> 00:05:07,260
We don't really have that many going on.


130
00:05:07,260 --> 00:05:10,020
And so I think this would be a great way to get them involved.


131
00:05:10,020 --> 00:05:13,300
Build a calendar between IPFS Camp and IPFS Thing.


132
00:05:13,300 --> 00:05:15,540
Those are the two main events that we have going each year.


133
00:05:15,540 --> 00:05:17,940
So people are always asking, when's the next thing?


134
00:05:17,940 --> 00:05:19,100
When are we going to see everyone?


135
00:05:19,100 --> 00:05:22,380
So this would be nice to supplement in between.


136
00:05:22,380 --> 00:05:24,500
And obviously keep up the momentum.


137
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:25,500
We just want to keep going.


138
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:26,500
We want to go further and wider.


139
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:27,500
And this is the way to do it.


140
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:28,500
And we'll see you soon.


141
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:29,500
Thank you.


142
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:30,500
Any questions?


143
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:31,500
Is this a mini...


144
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:32,500
Is this a full-time job?


145
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:44,540
I like IPFS and Friends.


146
00:05:44,540 --> 00:05:48,500
It's very friendly and you could have a number of things on the Friend side of the thing


147
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:50,300
while sticking with the IPFS Thing.


148
00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:51,300
Love it.


149
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:55,260
And even just some of the consistency of like, oh, this is what you can expect from this


150
00:05:55,260 --> 00:05:56,260
sort of thing.


151
00:05:56,260 --> 00:05:57,820
Do you see this...


152
00:05:57,820 --> 00:06:01,580
Is this scaled down to local meetup?


153
00:06:01,580 --> 00:06:02,580
Yeah.


154
00:06:02,580 --> 00:06:12,660
And what do you see as the sort of main topics or things?


155
00:06:12,660 --> 00:06:14,740
Is it an evening meetup?


156
00:06:14,740 --> 00:06:17,740
Is it a side event?


157
00:06:17,740 --> 00:06:18,740
You said speakers.


158
00:06:18,740 --> 00:06:19,740
Yeah.


159
00:06:19,740 --> 00:06:20,740
It can be.


160
00:06:20,740 --> 00:06:27,380
I feel like what would be nice is if someone is interested, depending on what they want


161
00:06:27,380 --> 00:06:28,380
to do.


162
00:06:28,380 --> 00:06:30,640
Because I think the person who has interest has something in mind.


163
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:33,700
So if they want to do an evening event, if they want to do something with speakers, they


164
00:06:33,700 --> 00:06:36,180
want to host a game night, if they want to do...


165
00:06:36,180 --> 00:06:40,540
Just to get the community together, technical or non, I think that's the more important


166
00:06:40,540 --> 00:06:43,140
part.


167
00:06:43,140 --> 00:06:46,940
And we'll help them.


168
00:06:46,940 --> 00:06:47,940
What are your thoughts?


169
00:06:47,940 --> 00:06:48,940
Dietrich?


170
00:06:48,940 --> 00:06:57,460
I was going to say, one of the event series that I loved was called Music Hack Day.


171
00:06:57,460 --> 00:07:01,700
And Music Hack Day was like what you just described, Nicole, was exactly what was cool


172
00:07:01,700 --> 00:07:05,780
about Music Hack Day, is that there was no centralized organization.


173
00:07:05,780 --> 00:07:10,660
It was if somebody wanted to host a Music Hack Day, they just posted a pull request


174
00:07:10,660 --> 00:07:16,180
to the Music Hack Day website, and the people that started Music Hack Day would either reject


175
00:07:16,180 --> 00:07:19,380
it and be like, this has nothing to do with music or whatever.


176
00:07:19,380 --> 00:07:23,300
But if they're okay with it, and there was just a community of people that had held a


177
00:07:23,300 --> 00:07:27,060
few of these before that were the people making the decision, would just add it.


178
00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:30,380
And it was just a title and a location and a date.


179
00:07:30,380 --> 00:07:35,660
And so each one was really unique, and oftentimes they started repeating.


180
00:07:35,660 --> 00:07:40,260
So like Music Hack Day Austin would happen a bunch of times over because that community


181
00:07:40,260 --> 00:07:43,100
of people formed around that one thing.


182
00:07:43,100 --> 00:07:45,860
And each one was then also really different.


183
00:07:45,860 --> 00:07:50,020
And it reflected the interests of that local community in a way that also didn't have to


184
00:07:50,020 --> 00:07:54,380
be a meetup group, and it didn't have to sign up, and it didn't have to put the official


185
00:07:54,380 --> 00:07:56,380
name or logo.


186
00:07:56,380 --> 00:07:59,660
But it could just be wherever they wanted to be, which was kind of nice.


187
00:07:59,660 --> 00:08:00,660
Very flexible.


188
00:08:00,660 --> 00:08:01,820
So I think that sounds really cool.


189
00:08:01,820 --> 00:08:04,340
The way you described it sounds awesome.


190
00:08:04,340 --> 00:08:07,060
Thank you.


191
00:08:07,060 --> 00:08:15,100
Are you interested in DeFi companies, Hyperledger, people like that as well, tying up with them?


192
00:08:15,100 --> 00:08:20,500
Yeah, if people want to sponsor, if people want to come in and collaborate, that would


193
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:21,500
be amazing.


194
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:22,500
Because in London, there's quite a bit.


195
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:23,500
Friends.


196
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:27,740
There's a big community in London that you could probably reach out to around this space,


197
00:08:27,740 --> 00:08:29,180
the whole blockchain space.


198
00:08:29,180 --> 00:08:30,180
Perfect.


199
00:08:30,180 --> 00:08:34,620
Yeah, bring IPFS to them, I think, would help their platforms.


200
00:08:34,620 --> 00:08:36,180
Please send us those recommendations.


201
00:08:36,180 --> 00:08:38,420
Yeah, let us know.


202
00:08:38,420 --> 00:08:41,540
Could we use these events for dogfooding stuff?


203
00:08:41,540 --> 00:08:42,540
Yes.


204
00:08:42,540 --> 00:08:44,420
Like force people to use our stuff?


205
00:08:44,420 --> 00:08:45,420
Yeah, absolutely.


206
00:08:45,420 --> 00:08:47,140
That's what it's for.


207
00:08:47,140 --> 00:08:53,300
Like I want to keep the content flowing in between IPFS and IPFS Camp so that we have


208
00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:56,820
something to present at these two major events.


209
00:08:56,820 --> 00:09:00,100
So yeah, absolutely.


210
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:01,100
Thank you.


211
00:09:01,100 --> 00:09:02,100
Awesome.


212
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:03,100
Any other questions?


213
00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:04,100
No?


214
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:05,100
Well, thank you.


215
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:06,100
Thanks.


216
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:23,660
Thanks for being here.
