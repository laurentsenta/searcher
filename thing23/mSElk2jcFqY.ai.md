### Current Web Problems

The current web system has several issues, including:

- Surveillance
- Lack of data ownership
- Lack of identity ownership

A better design could fix these problems by utilizing content-addressed data, providing user agency, and ensuring data storage in a user-owned and controlled environment.

### Pyrgos: A Global Private File System

Pyrgos is designed to provide user agency through:

- Signed content address data
- Human-readable paths
- Support for existing browsers

The system includes an application sandbox that allows running untrusted code over private data without risking data leaks or unauthorized access.

Several applications can be run within the Pyrgos system, including word processors, media players, text editors, and more.

Pyrgos also provides permissions for applications to access specific data, enforce restrictions, and facilitate communication between users and apps.

## Key Takeaways

- The current web system has several issues, including surveillance, lack of data ownership, and lack of identity ownership.
- Pyrgos is a global private file system that provides user-owned data and identity through secure, private, and peer-to-peer applications.
- Pyrgos enables users to have control over their data and supports multiple applications within the system.
- An application sandbox is used to ensure data privacy and security.
- Users can grant permissions to applications for data access and communication within Pyrgos.
