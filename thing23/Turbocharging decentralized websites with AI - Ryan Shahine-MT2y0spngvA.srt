1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,640
I'm Ryan, the co-founder of Portrait, and Portrait is a no-code decentralized website


2
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:09,640
builder.


3
00:00:09,640 --> 00:00:15,240
Today I'll be talking about how we use GPT to build decentralized websites with a single


4
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:16,600
click.


5
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:20,280
So that's a short introduction on my side, co-founder of Portrait.


6
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:28,380
I'll talk a bit about what Portrait is, what we're aiming to solve, and then we'll dive


7
00:00:28,380 --> 00:00:29,660
into a demo.


8
00:00:29,660 --> 00:00:36,960
We'll dive into a demo on how we can actually generate a decentralized website with a single


9
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:37,960
click.


10
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:38,960
Everything's alright?


11
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:39,960
Okay, yeah.


12
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:45,160
And what kind of implications that has.


13
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:50,620
So after that, after the demo, we'll finish with a food for thought where we kind of consider


14
00:00:50,620 --> 00:00:55,240
the ethical implications of AI.


15
00:00:55,240 --> 00:00:56,240
So first off, Portrait.


16
00:00:56,240 --> 00:00:57,240
Why Portrait?


17
00:00:57,240 --> 00:01:04,400
Well, Web3 is kind of characterized by being in control of your identity, it's kind of


18
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:07,560
ownership over data, those type of things.


19
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:15,280
And when we look at Web3 today, we can ask ourselves, are we truly able to be in control


20
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:16,920
of our data?


21
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:23,240
So to give a short example, if you'd like to write in Web3, in Web2 you go to Medium


22
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:25,860
or use WordPress, for whatever that means.


23
00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:34,280
But in Web3 you can use solutions such as Mirror, or Paragraph, or Sigil, which is an


24
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:36,080
alternative to Mirror.


25
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:40,600
There are many solutions out there to write your blogs.


26
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:46,640
And if you'd like to release an NFT collection, there are 135 solutions to actually do that.


27
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:50,880
So for every single dev, for every single use case, there are a lot of solutions out


28
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:51,880
there.


29
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:56,080
And if you'd like to find the conjunction between two things, or even more things, that's


30
00:01:56,080 --> 00:02:00,440
where things really start to get more complicated.


31
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:04,960
Because what if you'd like to write and release an NFT, or you publish videos and you'd like


32
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:07,480
to blog about something?


33
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:15,760
So let's say Joe, who owns Joe.eth, would like to express himself in various different


34
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:16,840
ways.


35
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:22,600
So he uses an array of different devs to actually do that.


36
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:28,880
But Joe.eth is more than a textual representation of his identity.


37
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:33,220
There's also the ability to create a visual representation, and that's able to be done


38
00:02:33,220 --> 00:02:39,000
through the content hash, which you actually can set in the NS Domain Manager.


39
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:48,400
And you can actually map your ENS domain to specific content located on IPFS.


40
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:53,400
On top of that, there are browsers out there, such as Brave and Opera, that natively support


41
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:55,400
resolving ENS domains.


42
00:02:55,400 --> 00:03:00,480
So we kind of built the logic to build decentralized websites.


43
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:05,720
But the ability to...


44
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:08,520
So yeah, just to round it up.


45
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:15,760
As of now, you can only map one content hash to your ENS domain.


46
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:23,600
So that would mean that Joe can map only one way of expressing himself to his domain name.


47
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:28,800
And what Joe likes to do is map everything to his ENS domain, right?


48
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:33,120
And in order to do that today, Joe has to be part of the subset of Web3 creators that


49
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:34,840
are actually technical.


50
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:38,880
And then he'd have to design and code his own website and publish that either through


51
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:43,160
Fleek or 3rdWeb, and then map the content hash to his ENS domain.


52
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:48,120
Now, I think everyone in this room is quite technical, and for everyone in this room,


53
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:49,680
that would be an easy job.


54
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:55,540
But we are part of the subset of the more technical individuals in the space.


55
00:03:55,540 --> 00:03:58,800
So for the entire set, there's no solution out there.


56
00:03:58,800 --> 00:03:59,800
And that's what we're building.


57
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:03,940
So we're building a no-code decentralized website builder that allows anyone to truly


58
00:04:03,940 --> 00:04:07,480
express themselves through Web3.


59
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:12,160
As you can see, on the left-hand side, there's an example of what we've built.


60
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:15,840
You truly control your own website from A to Z.


61
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:21,220
And this is just a quick visual of what we're building.


62
00:04:21,220 --> 00:04:26,880
So when you're building a solution for Web3, or for the new internet, so to speak, you


63
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:32,340
kind of have to think about, are we just building X for blockchain?


64
00:04:32,340 --> 00:04:34,260
Are we building Uber for blockchain?


65
00:04:34,260 --> 00:04:36,640
Are we doing Airbnb for Web3?


66
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:42,720
Because if you're doing that, you should really stop doing that and kind of try to find a


67
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:43,960
new purpose in life.


68
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:51,160
But if you're building a solution for Web3, you should start from the beginning and wonder,


69
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:57,960
what does Web3 actually bring that we can build a better version of, let's say, a Webflow?


70
00:04:57,960 --> 00:05:01,280
And Portrait is not Webflow.


71
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:04,120
Portrait is fundamentally different than Webflow.


72
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:09,400
And I'll tell you, I'll showcase that in a bit, because Web2 is obviously siloed and


73
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:11,280
Web3 is open.


74
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:14,600
And we took some time to think about that.


75
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:21,380
And we realized your Ethereum address will be mapped to a website, to a visual representation.


76
00:05:21,380 --> 00:05:25,040
But there's a lot of data out there which is mapped to your Ethereum address.


77
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:29,160
Think about event attendances through PoE apps.


78
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:34,080
Think about linking your Ethereum address to your Forecaster account.


79
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:38,600
Such things do have implications, and we'll dive a bit deeper into that.


80
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:43,800
But for us as the founders of Portrait, when we decided to build a product, we thought


81
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:46,800
about how can we create a better user experience.


82
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:48,840
So there are kind of two sides to it.


83
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:51,320
From one side, it's very easy to build a decentralized website.


84
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:54,400
On the other side, there will be some implications.


85
00:05:54,400 --> 00:06:01,200
All right, so now I'll dive into a demo of what we're actually doing.


86
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:10,680
And we can kick this off with trying to find a certain individual on Etherscan or whatsoever,


87
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:12,360
and actually find his address.


88
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:15,960
And we can actually generate a portrait for that person.


89
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:20,240
So let's take Vitalik.


90
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:24,080
Kind of looking up his address.


91
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:25,080
We can put that into...


92
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:26,080
So we're actually...


93
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:29,960
This is actually live right now, so our users have access to this.


94
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:39,880
But I'll run a local demo.


95
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:43,160
And it truly is with a single click.


96
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:48,360
So well, these are two clicks actually, but we do have to add a disclaimer that you're


97
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:56,080
actually running better software, and who knows what GPT will spit out, right?


98
00:06:56,080 --> 00:07:01,320
We're also kind of adding tags to create recommendations, but that has nothing to do with portrait AI.


99
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:06,800
So when we think about Vitalik, what kind of tags would you select?


100
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:09,360
Anyone in the crowd?


101
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:11,160
Sorry?


102
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:13,120
It's hard to see.


103
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:16,600
Is this better?


104
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:20,080
I think we can kind of go for...


105
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:21,080
Technologist?


106
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:25,520
That would be a good one.


107
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:34,000
Game changer, possibly?


108
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Problem solver.


109
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
All right.


110
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:41,760
I think software engineer would be probably a right fit as well.


111
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:46,200
Right, so now we're generating the portrait.


112
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:52,160
Just make sure that...


113
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:54,240
And you actually have kind of this...


114
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:58,840
You actually see this kind of monologue with portrait AI, and he kind of will introduce


115
00:07:58,840 --> 00:08:09,440
himself as portrait AI, the navigator of the cyber realm.


116
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:15,160
And so Vitalik has quite some data mapped to his Ethereum address, so it might take


117
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:16,680
a minute.


118
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:17,840
So your portrait is ready.


119
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:23,160
And that was quite interesting, because we're not in control of what GPT spits out.


120
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:27,600
So every time we generate a new portrait, even for Vitalik, new information will kind


121
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:28,640
of emerge.


122
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:35,640
So today we saw that he was in favor of removing...


123
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:37,680
Or in favor of daylight savings, right?


124
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:39,320
And abolishing.


125
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:40,800
So it was abolishing daylight savings.


126
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:47,040
I mean, that's pretty personal, kind of relevant information there.


127
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:54,320
And all we did was just kind of fetch data mapped to his Ethereum address.


128
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:59,840
So we'll actually visit the portrait that's been generated as well.


129
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:07,840
I know that you might be able to see kind of his face here.


130
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:10,560
But we can spit out a personal website.


131
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:16,840
Here we'll see some NFTs, but these are probably airdrop to him.


132
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:20,040
And then we'll also see a biography about him.


133
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:22,060
And we're even adding his personal links.


134
00:09:22,060 --> 00:09:26,400
So that's one example.


135
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:29,440
We'll actually dive into another example right away.


136
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:34,840
And with that example, I will also dive a bit more into kind of the implications of


137
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:39,420
AI and Web3 together.


138
00:09:39,420 --> 00:09:41,040
So let's try this one again.


139
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:43,960
We can actually stay right here.


140
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:46,320
And let's take Brian Armstrong, for example.


141
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:51,560
So Brian Armstrong Ethereum address.


142
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:54,640
I'm not even aware of what his Ethereum address is.


143
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:57,400
I'm just simply Googling it.


144
00:09:57,400 --> 00:10:01,580
I'll click the first link that pops up.


145
00:10:01,580 --> 00:10:03,180
And I'll copy his Ethereum address.


146
00:10:03,180 --> 00:10:08,880
I'm not even sure whether this is his Ethereum address or not.


147
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:09,880
Let's paste that in.


148
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:18,480
And we'll do the same thing again.


149
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:28,640
Starting from zero, use portrait AI.


150
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:34,100
And for Brian, we can kind of select similar tags.


151
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:36,820
But let's take a few new ones.


152
00:10:36,820 --> 00:10:38,520
We can take technologists as well.


153
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:42,400
Let's take kind of political advocate because of his...


154
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:43,400
Yeah, okay.


155
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:46,520
Let's take political advocate as well.


156
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:50,160
And progressive thinker.


157
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:55,640
Now we're generating a personal portrait for Brian.


158
00:10:55,640 --> 00:11:04,520
Hopefully, if that's his actual address.


159
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:24,680
Lo and behold, we know that the Ethereum address is mapped to Brian Armstrong.


160
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:31,600
Not only that, so we actually know that he...


161
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:34,440
From a prototype to a public company.


162
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:40,640
And that's all we know by just fetching data from his Ethereum address.


163
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:44,280
And I actually tried his specific address a few times.


164
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:52,520
And sometimes the AI would actually spit out that he went to a certain event and that he's


165
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:55,240
actually the CEO of Coinbase.


166
00:11:55,240 --> 00:12:03,680
And I'd like to talk more about attendance at events through ProApps, for example.


167
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:09,680
Because let's head back into the keynote.


168
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:12,680
And that's because...


169
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:15,440
Actually let's take a step back.


170
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:27,040
So when we go back to Etherscan, is there something someone notices about his address?


171
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:29,920
There are quite some funds there, right?


172
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:37,480
And we now know that this is the address of Brian Armstrong.


173
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:39,800
Just putting that out there.


174
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:46,400
And Brian knows that he is a notable individual and Brian knows that he has to take security


175
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:54,640
measures because of that, he can actually be a bit more confident in publicly showing


176
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:58,320
his funds and his ETH balance.


177
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:06,560
But do you or does anyone else that has these funds and uses Farcaster and uses ProApp to


178
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:15,000
attend events, for example, does that individual take the right security measures?


179
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:18,240
We can kind of look at this from...


180
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:23,360
When you're at holiday, don't take photos and publish them on social media because burglars


181
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:27,480
can break into your house and kind of pee on your couch.


182
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:29,120
And that was something like...


183
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:30,120
We'd say...


184
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:31,120
Okay, boom.


185
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:36,840
We have that level of information, we know, and we're not doing that.


186
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:45,000
But we can actually, with Web3 and with AI and GPT, we can actually take that a bit,


187
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:50,660
a step further, where these photos, these holiday photos, are kind of in the moment


188
00:13:50,660 --> 00:13:57,080
where a burglar or anyone, a malicious, a bad actor, a malicious person, actually should


189
00:13:57,080 --> 00:14:02,800
find that photo in the first place and then know that, hey, that person is away and I


190
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:05,640
can kind of pee on his couch.


191
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:17,200
But with the data mapped to your Ethereum address or data like event attendances through


192
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:21,920
ProApps, for example, which is mapped to your Ethereum address, and GPT, can we actually


193
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:26,520
predict whether an individual will attend a certain event?


194
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:32,160
And that's a step further because that's something we can actually predict in the future.


195
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:38,280
So here's the food for thought and here's what I'd like to end my presentation with


196
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:43,240
is that on one side, we can build great products from the user experience and on the other


197
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:49,160
side, we can ask, is it in the best interest of the community that most personal data is


198
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:55,520
available at any given time to anyone, combined with the fact that you can run any type of


199
00:14:55,520 --> 00:15:01,840
computation on top of the data, given that AI is becoming more accessible by the day?


200
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:03,880
Thank you very much.


201
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:07,200
So is it using like JGPT under the hood?


202
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:11,920
Yeah, a bit of GPT 3.5 and 4.


203
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:12,920
Okay.


204
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:18,600
Is there a way to maybe use something like Bloom, something open source instead?


205
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:19,600
Potentially.


206
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:21,080
Have you tried that?


207
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:26,680
So we kind of looked at what can we build in a very short timeframe.


208
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:32,480
It's actually, it's in beta also, and the open AI kind of API is kind of very accessible


209
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:33,480
today.


210
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:39,280
But I think that's a great question as well, from an ethical perspective.


211
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:44,560
Sam is also the founder of WorldCoin.


212
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:46,120
Enough said probably.


213
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:52,280
So we're also sharing all of this data with open AI itself as an organization, and we


214
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:55,320
should also look at the ethical implications of that.


215
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:56,320
Yep.


216
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:57,320
Yeah.


217
00:15:57,320 --> 00:15:58,320
For sure.


218
00:15:58,320 --> 00:15:59,320
Yeah.


219
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:04,400
So how do you see AI technologies evolving in the next few years?


220
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:08,680
And what are the new applications and use cases do you envision?


221
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:14,640
Oh, that's a very general question.


222
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:21,840
I don't think I can truly answer that because the developments we've seen over the last


223
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:24,720
year is something I wouldn't have expected myself.


224
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:30,120
I also have to add on top of that, that I'm not an expert in AI and I haven't followed


225
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:32,960
the space from the beginning.


226
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:38,040
So I'd like to see...


227
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:45,160
So personally, just last week, Elon registered x.ai, and I think that's a very interesting


228
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:47,600
emerging thing.


229
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:53,400
Everything surrounding Elon is interesting, to say the least, whether that's good or bad.


230
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:58,560
But it always has kind of a quick...


231
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:02,360
There's always like this attention.


232
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:05,760
There's always a lot of attention mapped to whatever he does.


233
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:11,800
So I think that's an interesting development.
