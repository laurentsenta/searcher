## List all the products, tools, and companies discussed

- ProbeLab: Collects and analyzes protocol data of IPFS network components for data-driven protocol design and optimization.
- probelab.io: Website displaying the collection of plots and findings derived from ProbeLab, also includes experiment methodologies and links to relevant GitHub repositories.
- Weekly reports: Snapshots of the network performance and health, monitoring websites and time to first byte from different regions.
- stats.ipfs.network: Hosts weekly reports and provides a summary of health and performance of the IPFS network (currently separate from probelab.io, but will be unified in the future).
- IPFS public DHT, bitswap, hydras: Content routing subsystems being focused on and measured.
- HTTP/Kubo: Comparing time to first byte from different regions with IPFS.

## List all the weak signals of things an almighty AI could do to improve the presenter's life

- Consolidation of data sources: Combining stats.ipfs.network and probelab.io under one platform to ensure a seamless and unified experience for users.
- More collaboration: Encouraging involvement from people who are building protocols, have content routing subsystems, or have monitoring and measurement tools to join the effort and showcase their work.

## List all the weak signals of things that are already great in the presenter's life

- Positive trend with IPFS performance: Content through IPFS now frequently loads faster than HTTP.
- Availability of detailed information: Probelab.io provides the context and details about the experiments conducted, allowing users to have a more comprehensive understanding of IPFS performance.
- Multiple data sources: Offering both stats.ipfs.network and probelab.io to cater to users interested in different levels of detail and context.
