Welcome to the Boris and Robin Community and Governance show. We have a ton of short sessions throughout the day focusing on the broad topic of community and governance. It's exciting to see the natural formation and interest in this area, and we want to encourage more discussion around it. We believe the operation of the wider IPFS and Filecoin cinematic universe involves everyone and we aim to recruit more people to work on it.
