00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,960
My name is Dietrich Ayala. I lead the Browsers and Platforms team at Protocol Labs, and it's


2
00:00:07,960 --> 00:00:14,280
my pleasure to kick off IPFS Thing by answering a question you all probably have. Why does


3
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:20,000
this event have such a weird name? Last year, we had the very first one of these in Iceland,


4
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:25,040
home of one of the oldest parliaments in the world, where for over a thousand years, the


5
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:30,320
council elders have been gathering to make decisions and talk about the most pressing issues


6
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:36,880
affecting their people. Likewise, when this guy, Juan, articulates a vision of digital


7
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:44,200
human rights that resonates with us, we gather now annually to chart the course forward for


8
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:49,920
the IPFS protocol itself. So the work that you're doing when you're building with IPFS,


9
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:54,920
when you're filing bugs against the protocol, when you're giving feedback in the specifications,


10
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:59,680
that important work, thank you very much for participating in this event to help determine


11
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:05,280
where IPFS goes from here, to be able to meet the needs of the internet that needs it very,


12
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:09,440
very badly. This is an important mission for me, after spending a significant chunk of


13
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:13,880
my life trying to make a better web, but still finding ourselves in a place where you can't


14
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:18,480
do something like share a photo with somebody inside your own house. Without that photo


15
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:22,940
leaving and going through the hands of 38 different for-profit companies, we would like


16
00:01:22,940 --> 00:01:28,760
to see a different future, and your participation here is making that possible. With almost


17
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:35,120
double the size of IPFS in 2022, you being here is what's going to make IPFS able to


18
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:39,640
achieve the vision that we have for the internet and the web that we want to see. So thank


19
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:45,080
you very much for attending. We have three days of talks in the core tracks, followed


20
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:50,960
by two days of mostly open time for you to gather, work together, collaborate, meet new


21
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:56,800
people, and build the internet that you want to see in the world. The event is almost entirely


22
00:01:56,800 --> 00:02:01,120
going to take place on this floor of this building, which should make it very, very


23
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:05,200
easy for everybody to find anything. Some of you are probably going to get lost anyway,


24
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:09,480
but there is a bunch of breakout rooms. We have the three main rooms with the tracks


25
00:02:09,480 --> 00:02:14,920
in them, a bunch of rooms that you can use to be able to self-organise, find your people,


26
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:20,160
help them find you, and make the things that you want to make. The seventh floor also has


27
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:24,560
breakout rooms for people to use that have probably a nice view. I haven't been up there


28
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:30,080
yet, but worth checking out. For logistics, if you haven't checked in already, check in,


29
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:36,840
get your badge. Here's some Wi-Fi information with a very creative password. The last couple


30
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:42,260
of days have a lot of open time. There's a lot of rooms. There's an unconference sheet


31
00:02:42,260 --> 00:02:48,080
shared in the Slack, in the general channel. Sign up there, broadcast what you want to


32
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:52,160
do and what you're interested in doing, even if it's not set in stone, so that the people


33
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:59,400
that are interested in that can join you and you can do amazing things together. Dinners,


34
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:04,160
the evening events, the system is very simple. You received a slew of emails from Luma. Go


35
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:08,240
to those emails, click that you accept and join. That way we know you're coming, and


36
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:11,960
then you get to eat with friends. Otherwise, you're going to be on your own, but that won't


37
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:15,120
be as fun as hanging out with us. We're going to be going to a bunch of different places


38
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:20,520
around Brussels. It should be a blast. Make sure you go into Luma and click all the yes


39
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:25,520
things here if you want to join. Join the Slack. If you're not there already, we will


40
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:31,200
be using the Slack for every important announcement for the duration of the event. Please watch


41
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:34,960
that. There's channels for each one of the tracks as well. If you want to talk to the


42
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:39,120
community of people that have shared interests in that track, that's the place to do that.


43
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:42,760
You can find all the speakers, ask questions to the track leads, get all the information


44
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:46,480
there, and then at the end of the week, we will take the Slack and make a little effigy


45
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:50,400
of it and burn it in the hopes that next year at IPFest we have something IPFest-based that


46
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:59,800
we can use instead of Slack for doing this. This event is under the IPFest community code


47
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:06,320
of conduct. Please be excellent to each other. Also, we are in a place known for its amazing


48
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:11,760
beers, so please intake in moderation and keep an eye out for folks that may or may


49
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:17,160
not need assistance and help. If you need assistance from any of us, please reach out


50
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:24,520
to me, Boris from Fission, Nicole, who I'm not sure are in the room, but they checked


51
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:28,300
you in at the registration desk. Those folks and also this email address where all of us


52
00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:34,120
organizers are there. We're here to help. Just reach out if you need anything from us.


53
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:38,720
Thank you to everybody who participated in making this event happen. These events happen


54
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:44,200
through the hard work and many, many months of planning across a number of different organizations,


55
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:48,040
protocol labs and a bunch of companies outside of it all participated in making this happen.


56
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:55,080
Thank you to all of these folks. Please give them a big hand.


57
00:04:55,080 --> 00:05:01,400
Your track leads in particular have done a ton of work to be able to create a very engaging


58
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:06,540
and quite full list of talks for each one of these tracks, so please be very appreciative


59
00:05:06,540 --> 00:05:09,400
to the people that are leading the tracks in each one of the rooms and all the speakers


60
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:14,360
that have put a bunch of work into their talks. This is going to be a short morning with a


61
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:19,840
really lot of information packed in. We have a long series of talks for this next hour


62
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:22,520
and we will fit a whole bunch of them in in a very short period of time, followed by a


63
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:29,720
couple of very important and exciting announcements for you all. Thank you for coming to IPFest


64
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:34,840
Thing. I really appreciate you being here and your commitment to making IPFest as best


65
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:38,840
it can be to meet the needs of the Internet we all want to see.


66
00:05:38,840 --> 00:06:06,840
So with that, I would like to hand it off to Yanis, our first speaker of the morning.
