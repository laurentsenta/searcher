## Overview

In this video, Torfinn Olsen introduces the IPFS Content Routing Workgroup, a group focused on discussing and addressing the challenges and complexities of content routing in IPFS. The Workgroup aims to tackle both immediate and long-term issues, such as the ongoing execution of DHT optimizations, delegated content routing, and API design. The ultimate goal is to create a federated network of indexer nodes, resulting in a decentralized solution.

## Content Routing in IPFS

Content routing in IPFS is a complex problem with many possible approaches, ranging from the traditional and highly reliable DHT to the more centralized and highly scalable IPFS Interplanetary Network Indexer (IPNI). The Workgroup consists of members from various teams (IPNI, IPFS stewards, ProbeLab, Bifrost), who collaborate to discuss and address these problems.

These discussions and solutions ultimately affect almost everybody using the IPFS network, with the objective of improving content routing experiences across the network.

The Workgroup is open to public participation, with meetings recorded on YouTube and notes shared publicly on Notion. Collaborative efforts focus on addressing various topics, including immediate DHT optimizations, delegated content routing puts, and BitSwap provider search delays.

## Current State and Future Plans

There are currently seven instances of the IPNI running globally, with plans to extend to more locations and improve the distribution of indexers across the network. The Workgroup aims to build relationships with index operators, discussing incentive solutions for running indexers, as well as explore the concept of ambient discovery to create a decentralized and scalable content routing solution.

Participation in the content routing workgroup is encouraged from the community, helping to expand discussions and bring diverse solutions to the table. The Notion page for the content routing workgroup provides an aggregation of information, decisions, and topics discussed, while the Slack IPFS content routing workgroup welcomes further participation and inquiries.
