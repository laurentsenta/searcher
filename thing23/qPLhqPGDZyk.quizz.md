## List all the weak signals of things an almighty AI could do to improve the presenter's life

- IPC documentation and tech: The presenter mentioned that both the documentation and technology are still rough and could be polished for ease of use.

## List all the weak signals of things that are already great in the presenter's life

- Spacenet: The IPC test network which allows faster block times and deployment of custom subnets is working, giving a positive signal for the project's progress.
- IPC Agent: The off-chain process that handles interactions between multiple blockchains is successfully abstracting the complexity of different blockchain communications for developers.
- M2 Deployment on Spacenet: The implementation of IPC in the Spacenet testnet is a significant milestone for the project.
