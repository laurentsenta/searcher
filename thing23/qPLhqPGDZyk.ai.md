## Overview

In this video, Alfonso De la Rocha introduces InterPlanetary Consensus (IPC), a way of scaling Falcon and adding consensus to existing distributed systems. With IPC, users are able to deploy horizontally the kind of blockchains and the kind of consensus layers that they need to accommodate Web2 scale loads into Web3, and fine-tune the underlying consensus algorithm and the underlying blockchain to fit the needs of their applications. The hierarchy of different kinds of blockchains is anchored to different upper layer networks, and the same technology stack as Filecoin's IPLD for the data store, and FEM for all the blockchain runtime is used. This talk provides a high-level overview of IPC, its use cases, and how it can be useful.

## Article

Alfonso De la Rocha introduces InterPlanetary Consensus (IPC), a way of scaling Falcon and adding consensus to existing distributed systems. The goal with IPC is to get into production after the release of Filecoin and provide a way of scaling the system by adding consensus to existing distributed systems. With IPC, users can horizontally scale their systems and fine-tune their underlying consensus algorithm and the underlying blockchain to fit the needs of their applications.

IPC was designed to overcome the limitations of blockchains which have a sequentialized operation and transaction processing, which limits scalability. IPC provides a way of adding fast optimistic local finality to your application, and with
