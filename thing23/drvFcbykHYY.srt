00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,200
All right, well, welcome to the integrating IPFS talk, or track. This track is kind of


2
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:14,840
like a grab bag of a few different talks that didn't quite fit into other tracks, or maybe


3
00:00:14,840 --> 00:00:22,000
a few smaller tracks that got combined together. So this is kind of our schedule for today.


4
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:27,440
I'm going to open us up with the first talk, are we interplanetary yet? David will be next.


5
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:32,440
He's going to talk about DURN, which is IPFS on mobile. And then Brooklyn will follow after


6
00:00:32,440 --> 00:00:38,360
that with decentralizing Auth and UCAN, too. Then we'll have a little lunch break, and


7
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:45,440
then Arakli will come in with a UCAN workshop. And that's slated for 90 minutes, but he's


8
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:50,480
just going to take as much time as he needs to within that to talk us through that. And


9
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:55,800
then we'll have Brooklyn again talking about IPVM. So this is kind of like the Brooklyn


10
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:59,720
and other people show. That's kind of what this is turned into.
