00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,720
My name is Ryan. I work with Little Bear Labs, and Dietrich volunteered me to attempt to answer


2
00:00:10,720 --> 00:00:17,320
this question of, are we interplanetary yet? Which, of course, is referring to the effort


3
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:24,640
to put IPFS in space and live up to this name of the interplanetary file system, not the


4
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:31,920
intraplanetary file system. So, like a true engineer, I'm not going to promise anything


5
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:36,600
I can't deliver, and I'm going to talk around the answer to this question and talk about


6
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:41,880
what we're doing right now, and probably eventually let Dietrich actually answer this question.


7
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:49,200
So, first, I want to introduce MySelli. So this is the new IPFS implementation. I'm thinking


8
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:54,960
of it more as a building block for deploying IPFS into space. I'm sorry I don't have any


9
00:00:54,960 --> 00:01:02,120
cool logo right now. If someone wants to contribute a logo of fungus in space, that would be great.


10
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:06,360
Design isn't really my thing, but if someone else out there has some great ideas, I would


11
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:14,440
love to have a logo contributed to this. So, IPFS in space. Obviously, this cannot be your


12
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:20,880
cloud server's IPFS. Whatever works here on Earth in our high-performance servers with


13
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:27,080
all these connections isn't going to work well on some satellite that maybe has an unreliable


14
00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:36,120
connection. Maybe in the case of my hardware in my office, like a 60-byte MTU isn't going


15
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:40,840
to work for the software that we use here on Earth with our mobile phones and laptops


16
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:45,680
and all that. So, kind of have to go back to first principles. In some ways, ask, like,


17
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:51,840
what even is IPFS? And I appreciate Robin bringing that up and helping give us the flexibility


18
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:57,640
to reimagine what these implementations mean, what they do. In our case, what this means


19
00:01:57,640 --> 00:02:03,160
is starting out with just content-addressable data, finding some way to move that across


20
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:07,520
the radio link from satellite to a ground station, and maybe calling that good enough


21
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:14,320
for now to say, okay, yes, this is IPFS. We're shipping SIDS into space or from space to


22
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:20,320
the ground. But, you know, as we dig into this, as we look at this, we've realized maybe


23
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:25,400
satellites are a little more like cloud servers than we've realized. Or maybe we can think


24
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:31,480
of them a little more like cloud servers. So, one of my goals with building this is


25
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:37,000
I want to give you all a platform where you can iterate on things like a better data transfer


26
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:42,760
protocol or maybe solving the peer-to-peer problem in space without worrying about the


27
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:47,280
hardware constraints of satellites or the specific details there. So, attempting to


28
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:56,120
use network layers as an abstraction to push away specificity of hardware and maybe emulate


29
00:02:56,120 --> 00:03:01,800
or approximate some of those constraints so we can build a more general solution that


30
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:07,040
we can test on the ground and still run in space. But we'll let the system integrators,


31
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:11,920
they worry about the radio, and we just worry about building the protocol and thinking about


32
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:19,640
how it's going to work. So, how do we actually become interplanetary?


33
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:25,840
So at some point later this year, this software will be running in a satellite in an orbit


34
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:31,180
near you. I can't say exactly when that will happen. I'm going to let Dietrich be the one


35
00:03:31,180 --> 00:03:35,680
to announce that once we actually know. I don't think we actually know right now, though,


36
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:39,600
when that's going to happen, and that's okay. That's like the reality of space, that things


37
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:44,880
change, schedules shift, especially when you're like a little tag-along like this mission


38
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:50,720
will be. But the reality is, as FogCoin announced, we are planning a demonstration mission, and


39
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:55,320
what this will look like is transmitting data from a single satellite to a single ground


40
00:03:55,320 --> 00:04:00,440
station, so shipping some blocks back and forth, and maybe even seeing those blocks


41
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:06,960
go from satellite to ground station to Qubo to the broader public IPFS network. I think


42
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:11,040
that's like the gold star that we're reaching for in terms of demos, so really seeing a


43
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:16,920
whole integration of space to big IPFS. So if you want to hear more details about that


44
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:21,880
and see a live demo of how it's working, I'm giving a talk on Monday in the integrating


45
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:29,320
IPFS track. Functionally, this software is essentially complete. We can show shipping


46
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:35,000
bytes or shipping blocks from a satellite over a radio to a ground station and then


47
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:40,920
to Qubo and resolving that as a complete DAG and a file that you can do something with.


48
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:46,920
So I'll be showing that off. If you know someone who could use this, if you know of a space


49
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:52,320
opportunity, please come talk to me or Dietrich. We would love to hear about other people that


50
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:59,120
can use this and try to publicize it to them and get more usage here. And if you want to


51
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:05,240
take a look at the code, see how it works, maybe give it a try. We have the space repo


52
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:11,360
in the IPFS shipyard organization and also we hang out in the space channel on the Falcoin


53
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:16,760
Slack. So we would love to hear from anyone who's interested or please come talk to me.


54
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:21,720
I'll be here the whole time. Let's talk about space and IPFS and the different challenges


55
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:28,720
there and what we can do with that. Thank you.
