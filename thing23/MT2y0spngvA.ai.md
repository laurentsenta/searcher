In this video, Ryan Shahine introduces his work on Portrait, a no-code decentralized website builder that uses AI to generate personalized websites with a single click. Watch the video [here](https://youtube.com/watch?v=MT2y0spngvA).

## Article

Hello, I'm Ryan, the co-founder of Portrait. Today, I will be discussing how we use GPT to build decentralized websites with a single click. Our aim is to create a no-code decentralized website builder that allows anyone to express themselves through Web3 fully. 

### Portrait

Portrait is a no-code decentralized website builder that allows users to take control of their identity and data on Web3. We built a logic to build decentralized websites that allow users to map the content hash to their ENS domain. Through Web3, we can create a better user experience for building decentralized websites while also considering the ethical implications of combining AI with Web3. 

### Demo

Our demo showcases how a portrait can be generated for an individual like Vitalik and Brian Armstrong on the platform. Upon entering their Ethereum address and selecting appropriate tags, Portrait uses AI (GPT 3.5 and 4) to generate a visual representation of their profile, fetching data mapped to their Ethereum address. This raises questions about what types of data are available through Ethereum and AI.

### Food for Thought

While we can build great products with user experience in mind, we need to consider the ethical implications of having the most personal data available at any given time. We also need to consider the fact that AI is becoming more accessible by the day and what this means for data privacy and protection.

## Key Takeaways

- Portrait is a no-code decentralized website builder that aims to allow users to fully express themselves through Web3.
- The platform uses AI (GPT 3.5 and 4) to generate personalized websites based on an individual's Ethereum address.
- Ethical implications and questions about privacy and data protection must be considered as AI becomes more accessible every day.
