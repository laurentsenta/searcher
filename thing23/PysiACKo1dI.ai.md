## Overview

In this video, Boris Mann, who works for Fission, discusses open source governance, funding, and the challenges faced by developers when dealing with corporate investments and community contributions. Boris also talks about finding solutions for funding open source projects with the help of Open Collective, a transparent donation platform. He also touches on the licensing and culture that surround open source projects and how these barriers can be overcome.

## Open Source Governance

Boris breaks down open source into three definitions:

1. Legal innovation: Open source licenses were created using copyright tools to lock open source code for reuse and sharing.
2. Peer-based co-production of software: Multiple people work together on a project with a governance model, such as the benevolent dictator for life (BDFL).
3. Ideology: Open source software should be accessible and consistently reused, instead of wasting resources on licensing or rewriting closed-source software.

Open source governance relies on communication and ensuring all stakeholders feel included in decision-making processes. Boris suggests practicing governance and coordination by using tools like quadratic voting and unconference scheduling.

## Open Collective for Funding

Boris is a strong supporter of Open Collective, a platform that enables open source projects to receive funds transparently and effectively. Through Open Collective, organizations or individuals can donate funds to support specific projects or developers, ensuring that important libraries and projects receive long-term support and maintenance.

The platform also promotes transparency in funding, ensuring donors know exactly where their money goes. Boris suggests experimenting with Open Collective to fund open source projects as it encourages participation, accountability, and community engagement.
