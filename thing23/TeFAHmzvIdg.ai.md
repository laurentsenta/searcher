## Overview

In this video, Ryan Shahine, co-founder of Portrait, discusses how IPFS is used to build decentralized websites. He explores the opportunities and challenges in building decentralized websites, the use of IPFS in Portrait's app, and their approach to solving design challenges.

## Decentralized Websites with Portrait

Portrait is a decentralized website builder and protocol that allows users to create, control, and govern their own visual identity on the internet. Built on IPFS and Filecoin, the platform enables users to create their websites without any coding or design experience.

The Portrait protocol separates the data from the actual website renderer, thus reducing the storage space needed to host individual user websites. With more than 10,000 users, the Portrait team is working on improving user experience, loading speed, and storage efficiency of their app.

## Achievements and Challenges

Portrait has already solved several design challenges in building decentralized websites on IPFS. They combine content addressing with location-based addressing to improve loading speed while maintaining a high level of trust in the content. They also improve serving speed by using IPFS alongside other on-chain storage protocols.

However, there are still some challenges yet to be solved:

1. **Authentication across multiple instances of Portrait**: Ideally, the team would like to move authentication away from a single entity and use a content-based authentication mechanism. This would make it easier for users to verify their identity and access their websites across different instances of Portrait.

2. **Efficiently generating Content Identifiers (CIDs) for users**: Currently, generating CIDs for every user's unique website data can be cumbersome and inefficient. An improved solution would enable the app to generate CIDs in a more efficient way and take up less storage space.

To further enhance Portrait's capabilities, the team is exploring the integration of AI-powered technologies like OpenAI's chat GPT to fetch data and create personalized website designs for users.

## Key Takeaways

- Decentralization is a spectrum with trade-offs between user experience and decentralization;
- IPFS and Filecoin form the backbone of Portrait, a decentralized website builder;
- Combining content addressing with location-based addressing can improve the speed of serving decentralized web content;
- Efficiently generating CIDs for users and creating content-based authentication mechanisms are challenges yet to be solved.
