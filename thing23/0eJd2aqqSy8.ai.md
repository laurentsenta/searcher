# Overview

In this presentation, Will Scott discusses the HTTP gateways aspect of IPFS that is operated by a set of centralized operators. The purpose is to provide a way to interact with IPFS without the need for a full IPFS client. To improve this process, Project Rhea was launched with the aim of decentralizing and improving the gateways while reducing centralization. The presentation highlights the limitations of the current gateway system and discusses the opportunities to make it faster by having more points of presence. Protocol Labs has already launched one of these CDNs with many locations through Project Saturn. 

The presentation discusses three goals of Project Rhea: retrieving from IPFS and Filecoin, validating Saturn as a CDN, and reducing centralization. The trust model will transition from the current system, where validation happens on servers, to clients validating their own content. This system will allow for greater flexibility and better speed to access content address data. The presentation mentions Bifrost Gateway as a new piece of software to be used as a refactoring of the gateway's code. It is able to make more semantically meaningful requests for the data needed to serve HTTP requests, allowing clients to verify their own content. LASI is another project that fetches content from IPFS and Filecoin networks.

Overall, Project Rhea aims to improve the HTTP gateways by making the process faster, reducing centralization, and validating Saturn as a CDN. It promotes a trustless HTTP spec where clients can verify their own content, and new software such as Bifrost Gateway and LASI are being developed to help achieve this goal.
