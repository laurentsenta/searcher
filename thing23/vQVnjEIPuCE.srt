00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,360
Hi, I'm going to present the interpreter specifications. The slides were mostly done by Robin, so thank


2
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:20,040
you. We have a website, specs.ipfs.tech. Very nice. There's a QR code. And it looks like


3
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:27,560
this. We have some basic specifications for now. We only have the architecture, meta specifications,


4
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:35,920
HTTP gateways, and the IPNS specifications, which might get updated soon.


5
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:39,720
So why did we do this? Why standards? Well, it should be possible to implement something


6
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:45,840
without having to look at Kubo and other things. In the long term, documentation will be better


7
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:51,240
than code, because code might have bugs, might not be clearly readable for everyone, so documentation


8
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:57,240
is always good. We will also be able to maintain a clear track record of everything that all


9
00:00:57,240 --> 00:01:01,480
the consensus, all the decisions that were made, and we will also support better test


10
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:06,520
writing. For example, for the gateway, we already have some work in progress for the


11
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:15,720
conformance test that Pietro talked about yesterday. And yeah, it's also a good way


12
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:22,360
to make it clear to bridge to other systems. So what are the goals of this very small project?


13
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:29,040
Well, small in size for now, but it's going to be big, we hope. Project, well, to look


14
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:34,080
good and give visibility to the specifications, because before this, they were just in a repository,


15
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:38,600
marked on files. It's not something nice to look at, and people are not going to look


16
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:46,200
for it. And if we have a website, it's easier, and it's an easier way to reference the specifications.


17
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:49,400
But at the end of the day, we keep it simple. It's still mostly marked down. It has some


18
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:57,800
add-ons that are specified, by the way, and it has table links and reference management,


19
00:01:57,800 --> 00:02:02,800
and we support the typical specification features, such as definition references, the keywords


20
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:10,560
from the RFC 2119. And yeah, we will be progressively adding more tooling in order to make it better.


21
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:14,840
So if you want to participate in this project, you can see the repository for the specifications


22
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:22,800
at ipfs.specs.generator, which is ipfs.spec.generator. How creative. And you can read the specs for


23
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:28,480
specs, which is mostly marked down with some additions. Or you can also just copy-paste


24
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:35,120
some spec and figure it out. And you can just run makewatch, and it will work. And yeah,


25
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:43,880
that was a very short talk. So we're now on track again.


26
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:45,600
What do you need?


27
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:46,600
What do I need?


28
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:51,040
It's all done. You don't need any help. What's next?


29
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:52,040
Write more specs.


30
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:53,040
Dark mode.


31
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:54,040
What's that?


32
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:55,040
Dark mode.


33
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:56,040
Dark mode.


34
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:57,040
Dark mode.


35
00:02:57,040 --> 00:03:05,040
We had dark mode, but it was not very good, so we had to remove it before releasing it.


36
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:07,040
Coming soon.


37
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:08,040
Yes.


38
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:11,040
We'll bring it back.


39
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:12,040
Yes.


40
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:17,040
We're waiting for your answers on what's coming. Is there any additions to the site that you're


41
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:19,040
planning? Is there any additions to the site that you're planning to make?


42
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:23,040
Yes, there's some updates we want to move. We want to add the IPIPs, which Lydell is


43
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:28,040
going to talk about in a minute. There's some other tweaks to make to the website, but it's


44
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:33,040
mostly working well. And add more specs.


45
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:37,040
Can the same spec generator be used outside of IPIP?


46
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:39,040
Yes, that's the goal.


47
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:48,040
We're in talks about using that to do specs.libp2p. I think probably next week we're going to


48
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:53,040
start working on that. I also have a code thing to bring out of storage about using


49
00:03:53,040 --> 00:04:01,040
that for multi-formats. We'll see how that intersects with the ITF thing. If IPLD, IPNI


50
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:07,040
want to put their specs on this, this is meant to be generic, so we can absolutely reuse


51
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:14,040
it. And the working group can work on the spec for specs and help everyone get this


52
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:16,040
moving along.


53
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:20,040
I was kind of wondering that. Should the working group working group also be a place that's


54
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:27,040
surfacing where all the different specs are?


55
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:32,040
We're keeping the name. I should shut up some days.


56
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:39,040
I don't think that the working group working group needs to do a list of specs. I think


57
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:46,040
we can have a list of spec sites. My thinking was to basically in the footer of all these


58
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:54,040
things have a web ring kind of thing for those who are old enough to remember. So that everyone


59
00:04:54,040 --> 00:05:01,040
can have their own theme and their own community for each segment, but also they are all tied


60
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:02,040
together.


61
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:31,040
Awesome. Thank you.
