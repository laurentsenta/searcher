## Overview

In this video, Taosheng Shi introduces the Pando project, a notarized IPLD data network which is a layer two data network of Filecoin. The project aims to provide lightweight and unbiased access to the metadata while discouraging historical revisionism. He also discusses the importance of integrating SQL capabilities and the concept of an HTAP transformation in building a Web3 big data ecosystem.

## Pando: A Layer Two Data Network for Filecoin

Pando is an IPLD data network that serves as a metadata service for Filecoin. Among its properties are data availability, lightweight and unbiased access to metadata, and discouragement of historical revisionism. Pando was initially developed as a reputation system for Filecoin, providing feedback closed loops for the open network. As part of the web3 data network, Pando aims to be a storage and retrieval layer that integrates well with Filecoin and IPFS.

The project focuses on various application scenarios, such as storage hierarchy, reputation systems, integration with data DAOs stacks, and modern data stack integration. Pando looks to enable faster access and unlock web3 applications by introducing SQL capabilities. Furthermore, it has the potential to bring together cross-function teams, organizations, and cross-domains on verifiable data, promoting transparency and reliability.
