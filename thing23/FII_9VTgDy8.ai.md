## Overview

In this video, Yuni and Nicole introduce the MIWA Team and their idea to launch IPFS + Friends Cafe. They discuss their first event experience, their goals with this initiative, and how the community members can get involved in hosting such events in their local areas.

## Introducing MIWA Team

Yuni and Nicole are part of the MIWA Team, which stands for Milky Way. A few months ago, they decided to create an event called IPFS and Friends Cafe to tag onto larger events, such as East Denver. Their goal was to provide a space for people to share ideas and collaborate in a workshop or cafe setting. They want to help community members create their own cafe-style events within their local ecosystems.

## First IPFS + Friends Cafe Experience

Yuni and Nicole launched their first IPFS + Friends Coffee pop-up at the Filecoin Foundation Hacker Base. The event was open for one day, and attendees could scan a QR code to register for future events, access resources, and sign up for IPFS camp and IPFS thing events.

The MIWA Team plans to lend a hand to community members interested in hosting their own IPFS + Friends Cafe events, offering logistical support, help securing speakers, providing swag and some funding, and guidance.

## Goals for IPFS + Friends Cafe

The main objectives of IPFS + Friends Cafe include:

- Growing IPFS community events
- Building a calendar of events between IPFS Camp and IPFS Thing
- Maintaining momentum for IPFS initiatives

## Getting Involved

If you're interested in hosting an IPFS + Friends Cafe event and need assistance from the MIWA Team, you can contact them through the Slack channel. They're open to collaborating with various industry players, including DeFi companies and Hyperledger communities. The events could also serve as an opportunity for the community to use and test IPFS products and platforms.
