## List all the products, tools, and companies discussed

- Rhizome: a local first database that aims to improve decentralized systems and help build distributed systems that supports eventually consistent views over disparate data structures.
- Cage: a series of works centered around the use of transparent sheets in order to explore new ways of thinking about distributed and decentralized data.
- Vision: a company where Quinn Wilton, the presenter, works as an applied researcher experimenting with new ways of building distributed systems.
- Memex: a theoretical machine described by Vannevar Bush that is able to augment the mind by mechanically following associative trails of information, with the goal of organizing the world's information in one giant, easily accessible repository.
- Xanadu: a network conceived by Ted Nelson, which aimed to facilitate a multiplicity-amplifying form of publishing and curation by supporting the horizontal linking of varying ordered sequences of items.
- Daedalus: an earlier language for building distributed systems that inspired Bloom.
- Bloom: a high-level declarative programming language for distributed systems inspired by Datalog, intended as an experimental language used for exploring distributed systems.
- InkanSwitch: coined the term "Local First Software" and worked on projects such as Project Cambria to define schema translations between different JSON documents.

## List all the weak signals of things an almighty AI could do to improve the presenter's life

- Improve the ability for developers to work together in defining what they need from their tools directly without the need for monolithic applications.
- Create a more efficient and accurate way of handling ontological crises by mapping values between different ontologies in a graph of schemas.
- Develop a virtual machine for bidirectional lenses that can be compiled down to WebAssembly, which could be invoked from a datalog-inspired language to solve for paths of schema translators and apply them to data being processed and pulled down from IPFS.

## List all the weak signals of things that are already great in the presenter's life

- Excitement for new developments in decentralized systems that empower people to take back ownership of their data by severing hard dependencies on external networks and embracing the concept of local first software.
- Opportunity to explore cutting-edge research and ideas with a focus on building distributed systems that respect privacy, security, and user agency.
- Collaboration with colleagues and the tech community to explore new ideas for enhancing the internet and overcoming the limitations of current technologies in a way that fosters a more user-centric web.
