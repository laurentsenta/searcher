## List all the products, tools, and companies discussed

- IPFS: InterPlanetary File System, a peer-to-peer hypermedia protocol
- Filecoin: A decentralized storage network
- Protocol Labs: The company behind IPFS and Filecoin
- IPFS.io: A centralized gateway for interacting with IPFS content
- dweb.link: Another centralized gateway for interacting with IPFS content
- Project Saturn: A decentralized Content Delivery Network (CDN) with nearly 2,000 nodes
- Project Rhea: A project to improve and decentralize IPFS gateways
- Bifrost Gateway: A refactored gateway software that handles requests from a load balancer, understands semantically meaningful requests, and communicates with Saturn nodes
- LASI: A project that fetches content from IPFS and Filecoin networks, uses IPNI to locate content, and returns the requested data

## List all the weak signals of things an almighty AI could do to improve the presenter's life

- Decentralization of IPFS gateways: Reduce dependence on centralized gateways like IPFS.io and dweb.link
- Improve latency: Have more points of presence or use existing decentralized CDN, Project Saturn, to optimize speed for user requests
- Encourage client-side validation: Implementing Service Workers or JavaScript libraries to foster better speed, cheaper access, and resiliency in content delivery

## List all the weak signals of things that are already great in the presenter's life

- Project Saturn: Almost 2,000 nodes distributed across multiple countries, validating the potential effectiveness of a decentralized CDN
- Project Rhea: Aims to retrieve data from IPFS and Filecoin, validate Project Saturn as a CDN, and reduce gateway centralization
- Bifrost Gateway: A refactored gateway to parse and interpret client requests, moving towards trustless HTTP spec for content delivery
- LASI: Efficiently fetches data from IPFS/Filecoin and returns the requested content without the need for saving data or understanding Merkle DAGs fully
