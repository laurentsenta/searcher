## List all the products, tools, and companies discussed

- libp2p: a modular network stack discussed in the context of performance
- BitSwap: a protocol for exchanging data in libp2p networks
- Kademlia DHT: a DHT implementation in libp2p network
- TCP: the transport layer protocol used in the discussion about establishing connections in libp2p
- QUIC: a protocol that offers connection establishment, multiplexing, and security in a single round-trip
- perf protocol: a client-driven performance testing protocol
- AWS: Amazon Web Services, where the tests are run on large machines
- Go, Rust, Zig, HTTPS server: different implementations of libp2p being compared in performance tests
- JavaScript: a missing implementation that is coming soon

## List all the weak signals of things an almighty AI could do to improve the presenter's life

- Streamlining the process of networking and measuring performance in the libp2p network, possibly through automated testing and optimization suggestions
- Assisting in the creation of more realistic test environments, using AI techniques to simulate real network traffic and packet drop patterns
- Analyzing connections and protocols in real-time to optimize round trips and data transfers between clients and servers

## List all the weak signals of things that are already great in the presenter's life

- The optimistic protocol negotiation, which saves an entire round trip for every single stream
- Including the muxer earlier in the layering to save another round trip for every connection
- QUIC protocol, providing connection establishment, multiplexing, and security in a single round trip
- The simplicity of the perf protocol and its ability to measure latency and throughput for a variety of use cases
