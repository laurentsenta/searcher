## List all the products, tools, and companies discussed
- Pyrgos: a global private file system with privacy and speed, providing capability-based access control and other features like BATs and Cryptree Plus.
- IPFS: InterPlanetary File System, used as the underlying infrastructure for Pyrgos.
- CAPs (Capabilities): Mirror, Read, and Write capabilities used for access control in the Pyrgos file system.
- BATs (Block Access Tokens): Low-level block-level access control in Pyrgos, providing post-quantum ciphertext-level access control.
- Cryptree Plus: A privacy-focused feature in Pyrgos which includes BATs, post-quantum design improvements, and additional metadata protection.
- Application Sandbox: A feature in Pyrgos that allows running untrusted code over private data, providing additional security to users.
- Concurrent GC (Garbage Collection): An optimization used in Pyrgos for handling large amounts of data quickly and efficiently.
- Fast file seeking: An optimization in Pyrgos that allows quick seeking within large files (useful for streaming videos, for example).
- Direct S3 access (AWS S3): An optimization in Pyrgos for offloading bandwidth by allowing users to directly interact with S3 for reads and writes, rather than going through the server.

## List all the weak signals of things an almighty AI could do to improve the presenter's life
- Improve the efficiency of the Pyrgos file system and optimize operations even further for better performance and less resource consumption.
- Provide better tools or methods for seeking files in Pyrgos, making it more convenient to use and interact with large files.
- Design more robust privacy protocols or implementations in Pyrgos to protect metadata and user data from adversaries with advanced capabilities, even in a post-quantum world.

## List all the weak signals of things that are already great in the presenter's life
- Pyrgos provides a global private file system with a focus on both privacy and speed, offering significant benefits for users who prioritize these aspects.
- The Application Sandbox in Pyrgos allows users to run untrusted code over private data, providing additional security and flexibility for users.
- Optimizations such as Concurrent GC, Fast file seeking, and Direct S3 access in Pyrgos have greatly improved the performance of the file system, allowing for quicker and more efficient data handling.
