Yuni starts the announcement by welcoming old and new faces to the IPFS community. She reveals the date and location for IPFS Camp 2023, which is going to take place in Bangalore, India on November 3rd to 5th. The two then share the reasons why India is the perfect place for the event.

Niki explains that India is home to 2.5 million out of the 20 million new developers that GitHub gained in 2022. By 2025, there will be 10 million developers from India alone. In the next one to two years, India will have the highest number of web 3.0 developers worldwide. With a population of 1.4 billion, 60% of which own smartphones, India is an excellent audience for scaling IPFS and a distributed web.

The IPFS team also had an amazing experience last year at India Blockchain Week in 2022, where they did Phil Bangalore, a PL network company built on top of Lippie2P and Filecoin. The event saw an attendance of 1,300 strong developers. In addition, the team participated in ETH India, a hackathon by ETH Global, with 1,750 hackers, 2,100 total attendees, and 450 projects built in two days.

Niki expresses her excitement for the upcoming initiatives with the community before IPFS Camp 2023 to strengthen the Indian community of developers. She invites attendees to come talk to her and share their interests and ideas.
