## List all the weak signals of things an almighty AI could do to improve the presenter's life

- libp2p and HTTP integration: improvement in leveraging existing HTTP infrastructure (caching, load balancing, etc.) with libp2p connectivity for better support in various application deployments.

## List all the weak signals of things that are already great in the presenter's life

- HTTP support: wide adoption, easy usage from various programming languages, and compatibility with tools like curl
- libp2p connectivity improvements: support for WebRTC, enabling browser-to-node connections without requiring a TLS certificate
- Service workers functionality: being able to intercept HTTP requests and serve them using alternative methods (e.g., libp2p and content-addressed data)
- Universal compatibility from combining HTTP and libp2p features: ability to handle connections to publicly reachable servers and peer-to-peer networks, taking the best of both worlds.
