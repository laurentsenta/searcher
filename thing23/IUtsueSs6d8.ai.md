## Overview

In this video, various track leads introduce their respective tracks that will be presented during the conference. These tracks cover a diverse range of topics, such as community and governance, integrating IPFS, measuring IPFS, show and tell, HTTP gateways, decentralized compute and AI, data transfer protocols, deployments and operators, databases, content routing, and IPFS on the web.

## Track Introductions

### Community and Governance

**By Robin and Boris**

This track involves sociotechnical systems and discusses topics ranging from open source development to dealing with regulators.

### Integrating IPFS

**By Ryan**

The track is dedicated to finding ways of integrating IPFS data with other platforms and making it more accessible and meaningful.

### Measuring IPFS

**By Yanis**

In this track, participants will learn how IPFS performs in different scenarios, such as video streaming, and understand its content discovery capabilities.

### Show and Tell

**By unknown (track lead not mentioned)**

This track invites participants to share their experiences, challenges, and successful implementations of IPFS in various projects.

### HTTP Gateways

**By Will**

This track explores various approaches to gateways and HTTP interoperability with IPFS.

### Decentralized Compute and AI

**By Irina (not present during the video)**

This track will discuss VMs and how they can be used with IPFS to enable more efficient data processing and decentralized computing.

### Data Transfer Thunderdome

**By Hannah**

This track aims to showcase different data transfer protocols, discuss their compatibility, and encourage collaboration among participants.

### Deployments and Operators

**By James**

This track targets those who are interested in putting IPFS and related protocols into production systems.

### Databases

**By J. Chris**

This track will highlight the role of databases in the IPFS ecosystem, supporting the idea that 2023 will be the year of databases on IPFS.

### Content Routing

**By Sid**

Explore the content routing features of IPFS and learn about DHT privacy in this track.

### Decentralized Compute and AI

**By Matt Hamilton (standing in for Irina)**

This track will cover topics such as the Falcon virtual machine, decentralized computing, and using IPFS to create a more interconnected web3 world.

### IPFS on the Web

**By unknown (track lead not mentioned)**

This track will focus on how IPFS data can be used with HTTP web pages and discuss the tools required to bridge the gap between IPFS and HTTP.
