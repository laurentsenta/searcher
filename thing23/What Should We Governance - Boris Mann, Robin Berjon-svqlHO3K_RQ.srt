1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,460
So, you know, since this is about community, we figured it would be a good idea to start


2
00:00:09,460 --> 00:00:14,920
off on some kind of kind and gentle note.


3
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:20,800
So I assume people here are familiar with what a postmortem is.


4
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:26,420
Postmortem is when something has gone wrong and you get together after the thing has gone


5
00:00:26,420 --> 00:00:30,520
wrong to discuss what went wrong.


6
00:00:30,520 --> 00:00:35,240
And one thing that people often find out when doing a postmortem is that we knew that something


7
00:00:35,240 --> 00:00:40,800
was going to go wrong, but either someone had figured it out but hadn't shared it well,


8
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:48,040
or someone could have thought about it but hadn't really believed that things were going


9
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:49,540
to fail as badly.


10
00:00:49,540 --> 00:00:53,340
So it turns out the knowledge that something was going to fail usually exists before the


11
00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:57,120
thing fails, unless it's a catastrophic surprise accident.


12
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:58,760
That's how it usually works.


13
00:00:58,760 --> 00:01:04,880
So the purpose of a premortem is to actually try to figure that out before it happens.


14
00:01:04,880 --> 00:01:10,960
The idea is really to get rid of optimism bias by projecting ourselves into the future,


15
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:16,540
say 10 years from now, noticing a failure and then going like, okay, it failed.


16
00:01:16,540 --> 00:01:21,920
Why do we know from today, but, you know, retrospectively with the hindsight of 10 years


17
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:27,300
in the future, how do we know that this was going to fail?


18
00:01:27,300 --> 00:01:33,280
And so, you know, I'm not saying that the ones that we listed are like the three only


19
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:34,280
failure modes.


20
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:40,240
I think that the idea is to invite people to sort of like think retrospectively that


21
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:44,560
way to try to figure out what might be wrong and what we should do about it today before


22
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:46,980
it actually goes wrong.


23
00:01:46,980 --> 00:01:53,960
But I think one thing that's pretty clear is that if, you know, 10 years from now, IPFS


24
00:01:53,960 --> 00:02:00,560
has failed, it seems unlikely or implausible that it will be for lack of technical excellence.


25
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:05,280
I think we've all seen, you know, of course in the community, but, you know, even more


26
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:12,680
clearly in the past few days that this is an absolutely excellent community at the technical


27
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:13,680
level.


28
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:18,480
And even though there are issues, I think we're very confident that they will be conquered.


29
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:23,640
However, we can imagine cases in which IPFS will have failed.


30
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:27,400
So let's imagine it's 2033.


31
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:31,560
And you know, these are just like three example potential premortems to think about.


32
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:41,280
But the first one is IPFS has succeeded, you know, to some degree, but it has been captured


33
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:43,760
by some big tech company or other.


34
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:48,080
So, you know, pick your least favorite one.


35
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:53,080
And they are basically for all intents and purposes owning IPFS.


36
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:58,480
And you know, in the same way that email and large parts of the web today, despite being


37
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:03,600
technically or supposedly some degree of decentralized, are, you know, captured and owned.


38
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:06,680
And so, you know, that's the failure mode for that first one.


39
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:12,240
If we look back, you know, what has failed to lead to that failure mode?


40
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:18,000
Well, one way of thinking about it is that perhaps we didn't think of capture resistance


41
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,080
sufficiently well.


42
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:25,200
We you know, there's a tendency in our community to imagine that if you make something decentralized,


43
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:29,560
if the tech is decentralized, then everything will just go well because the tech is decentralized.


44
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:34,800
But you know, the people who work to capture markets don't go like, oh, that tech is decentralized.


45
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:35,800
That's unfortunate.


46
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:39,280
Let's just like go monopolize something else.


47
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:44,920
You know, you have to get into a cybersecurity mindset about this and like really threat


48
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:49,520
model the hell out of it, because they will keep coming and they will find an exploit


49
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:52,280
and they will eventually monopolize something.


50
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:59,080
And so, you know, we need to build sort of the community culture of thinking not so much


51
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:03,160
in terms of decentralization, even though that's an important technical property, but


52
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:08,000
in terms of capture resistance so that we keep ourselves honest in terms of whether


53
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,400
we're succeeding on that front.


54
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:12,000
So that's one failure mode.


55
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:18,200
A second potential failure mode is the one in which, again, IPFS is maybe even super


56
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:23,200
successful, but it is entirely a Protocol Labs product.


57
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:27,200
Maybe we pretend that there's some kind of community and we take input, like we have


58
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:30,000
like developer events and we're like, yes, we listen to you.


59
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,600
This is very important.


60
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:33,400
We will consider it.


61
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:36,240
But it is actually completely owned by PL.


62
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:39,640
And this is a failure mode because this is supposed to be locked open.


63
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:42,160
This is supposed to be a common sting.


64
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:44,880
And how would we reach that kind of failure mode?


65
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:50,440
Well, if we don't take the steps to develop institutional capacity in the community to


66
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:56,520
properly own things and to properly govern things in a way that is open, then we could


67
00:04:56,520 --> 00:05:00,640
easily progressively slip into that mode, even with good intentions.


68
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:08,040
And we've seen that happen over the past decade in tech.


69
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:11,160
And so a third failure mode is actually in this case.


70
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:15,840
So this is the one in which IPFS actually almost doesn't exist anymore.


71
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:23,440
And the thing that has happened is at some point there was some kind of absolutely catastrophic


72
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:32,520
usage of IPFS for some major phishing or some horrendous CSAM network or something like


73
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:33,520
that.


74
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:38,240
And the reason that happened is because we as a community didn't take the steps necessary


75
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:44,240
to integrate into the broader institutional ecosystem and play by its rules and actually


76
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:46,560
support people in building good things.


77
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:54,560
So again, this is a third case in which the failure is a failure of community and governance,


78
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:56,520
hence why we're here.


79
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:57,520
So now that I've...


80
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:58,520
Yes?


81
00:05:58,520 --> 00:05:59,520
Do you want to ask?


82
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:00,520
Can anyone mention other failures?


83
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:12,520
Yes, this is going to be a participatory session, so you should expect not to sleep in the back.


84
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:17,680
How else do we fail?


85
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:19,160
Speak in the mic, Boris.


86
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:23,880
How else do we fail?


87
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:28,740
We can fail at delivering the decentralization bit.


88
00:06:28,740 --> 00:06:34,640
We can be just smoke and mirrors at some point over time, adding more and more centralized


89
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:36,560
pieces of infrastructure.


90
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:44,400
So on the website, it may say we are decentralized, but if you shut down, like Amazon goes down,


91
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:46,200
suddenly content routing does not work.


92
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:50,400
I'd say that's a failure mode that should be on the list.


93
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:53,800
HTTP with extra steps.


94
00:06:53,800 --> 00:07:01,000
Inefficient HTTP should not be synonym for IPFS.


95
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,920
That's a good one.


96
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:06,120
Anyone else?


97
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:08,280
So I think that was a really good one to capture.


98
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:09,280
Addy has one.


99
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:12,280
Can you wait for the mic?


100
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:14,280
Yeah, sorry.


101
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:17,280
I'll run it.


102
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:20,280
It's okay.


103
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:21,280
Is it working?


104
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:22,280
Yes.


105
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:28,360
I was going to say something around complexity or obfuscation and complexity, so we lack


106
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:32,120
mainstream adoption, especially outside of the West.


107
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:33,120
Yes.


108
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:38,840
Oh, look, everyone has failures now.


109
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:39,840
Keep the sharing coming.


110
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:42,120
It's a plus one on what Addy's saying.


111
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:44,760
Yeah, like poor product market fit.


112
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:50,320
Yeah, sure, we're open source and we scratch our own itches, but we really have to stand


113
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:52,800
back and say, is this a G-Wiz project?


114
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:54,600
Like, oh, great.


115
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:57,080
We actually have an interplanetary file system.


116
00:07:57,080 --> 00:07:58,080
It's on satellites.


117
00:07:58,080 --> 00:07:59,080
It's on Mars.


118
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:00,240
Cool.


119
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:03,480
Nobody uses it because it doesn't really solve a problem, right?


120
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:08,800
Because there's like infinitely easier, faster, simpler ways to do the same thing.


121
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:13,800
So there's a tendency for nerds to nerd out, right?


122
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:17,560
And we need to constantly check ourselves.


123
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:18,560
We used to do this at Mozilla.


124
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:21,840
It was like, oh, we could totally do that in the browser, right?


125
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:23,320
We can totally do that.


126
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:27,560
Yeah, we can remotely start a car using a browser.


127
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:29,240
But should you, right?


128
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:30,240
That's the question, right?


129
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:34,240
That's a failure mode is to not step back and say, should we do this enough?


130
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:38,460
And also that means that we need to be bringing people into the community who provide checks


131
00:08:38,460 --> 00:08:41,080
and balances against groupthink.


132
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:42,320
Yep.


133
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:43,520
Yep.


134
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:46,120
Does anyone else want to be pessimistic this morning?


135
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:47,800
All right.


136
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:49,800
Well, thank you.


137
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:50,800
Thank you.


138
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:52,760
No, this is definitely very good input.


139
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:57,280
So in terms of like thinking about it, and again, like I just picked the three that we


140
00:08:57,280 --> 00:09:02,360
thought about, but like the ones that you brought are also important.


141
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:06,480
Based on this kind of like premortem exercise, we can figure out the things we want to build


142
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:13,200
and why we want to build community and governance capacity to provide these checks and to provide


143
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:17,160
this input and to keep ourselves honest and on track.


144
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:22,880
And so, you know, this involves like really figuring out how to avoid capture, how to


145
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:26,120
build collective action, and how to play well with others.


146
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:31,680
Those are like really important institutional aspects, aspects of governance.


147
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:37,840
And I think from all those that we heard also map one way or another into this, right?


148
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:44,520
If we have ways of like getting real community input, and that's not just like a call center


149
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:52,000
input, but that's actually people have voice that translates to action.


150
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:59,560
I think we can avoid a lot of these issues because that's how we are smart together.


151
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:07,340
So you know, in terms of like, do you know why you should be afraid of the French?


152
00:10:07,340 --> 00:10:18,560
Because they eat pain for breakfast.


153
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:28,160
So things we would like to get out of this workshop session today are we'd really like


154
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:35,160
to get an idea of the pain points regarding governance of the IPFS ecosystem.


155
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:39,240
I mean, a lot of you are involved in it.


156
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:43,380
When you are involved in it, what is painful for you, but also what is painful in terms


157
00:10:43,380 --> 00:10:49,120
of the people who aren't showing up or the support you're not getting or things that


158
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:52,600
you've, everyone has been saying, yes, we should be doing that for five years.


159
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:55,000
And it still hasn't happened.


160
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
That kind of painful.


161
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,240
Oh, I see Lidl's face.


162
00:10:57,240 --> 00:11:00,000
I think I like struck a chord right there.


163
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:07,080
We're going to talk about browser extensions.


164
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:08,600
Every community goes through this, right?


165
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:13,800
So we can just like enumerate these things, but we can also solve them.


166
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:21,440
And one thing also is that is, you know, doing governance well and right is something that


167
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:26,560
is very much an art and hasn't been developed into very much of a science yet.


168
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:32,040
And so like sharing ideas and thoughts and best practices about how to do it well is


169
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:35,400
also something that we'd like to invite today and in the future.


170
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:43,440
I think very specifically, no pain, no gain, meaning we actually have to practice governance,


171
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:48,560
which means we will also sometimes fail at governance.


172
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:53,040
And what we have to do is learn from it so that we can get better at it.


173
00:11:53,040 --> 00:12:00,280
I mean, you know, in real world governance is always absolutely messy and chaotic and


174
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:01,900
horrendous.


175
00:12:01,900 --> 00:12:09,960
And so, you know, like, yes, we'd gain for breakfast because no, wait, that doesn't work.


176
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:16,520
And so, you know, we want to basically use this to strengthen the ways in which we cooperate


177
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:23,080
and work together and like work with other institutions and the broader community.


178
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:30,520
And so, you know, just like as some open ideation issues, the list is actually longer.


179
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:35,560
Of course, we'll get to a longer list right afterwards.


180
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:40,120
But you know, one of the questions, some of the questions you need to think about when


181
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:43,880
thinking about governance in concrete terms in terms of like how to make it happen is


182
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:45,720
like, what is it that we're governing?


183
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:48,160
Actually, what are the resources that are in the commons?


184
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:50,340
Is it the open source code?


185
00:12:50,340 --> 00:12:52,400
Is it the standards?


186
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:55,500
Is it the infrastructure?


187
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:57,380
Is it the community culture?


188
00:12:57,380 --> 00:13:01,200
It might be all of these things, but it's good to have a clear idea of what it is that


189
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:04,000
we're actually managing through this governance process.


190
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,760
There always has to be a resource, right?


191
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:12,200
You're not just like governancing for the fun of like having meetings, right?


192
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:16,560
The other way, the other important thing is like which actors, you know, in terms of like


193
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:22,280
specific positions in the community, like people who use it, people who code on it,


194
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:26,280
people who might have, you know, opinions about things, people who write, who create


195
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:32,040
logos, I don't know, like different roles, like which of these actors do we like to see


196
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:37,880
taking which roles in terms of governing things is also an important thing.


197
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:43,280
Like who gets to have maybe more say over some parts, who gets to have like a specific


198
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:47,460
kind of input into this or that kind of resource.


199
00:13:47,460 --> 00:13:52,080
And then based on this, like how do we organize these to achieve the goals that we want to


200
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:53,080
achieve?


201
00:13:53,080 --> 00:14:01,080
And so, Boris, do you want to jump on the parking lot a bit?


202
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:02,080
Live up here?


203
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:03,080
Yep, you're live now.


204
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:04,080
Live, live.


205
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:05,080
Awesome.


206
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:11,160
Yeah, so this was a bit of a parking lot pointing out to some different areas.


207
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:18,160
We've got one area that Robert and I have prepared and almost given a little update


208
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:22,840
of sort of some emergent stuff that we see happening.


209
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:27,440
We've got about 15 minutes, we've got five minutes in, so I'd like to take 10 minutes


210
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:31,080
and basically go through some of these things so that we can start gathering this as a list


211
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:34,880
of like, oh, are we just going to come and talk about it here or is this something that


212
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:39,560
we're going to kick off and be like, how does this flow into other events and meetings and


213
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:42,840
other things that we have over time?


214
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:45,000
Standards.


215
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,280
What does that even mean?


216
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:53,400
I wanted to put that up there to kick things off because I think we do multiple kinds of


217
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:54,400
things.


218
00:14:54,400 --> 00:15:02,240
We do standards that might be happening at the W3C or the ITF that I guess sits in Dietrich's


219
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:03,240
and your hands.


220
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:04,240
Is that correct?


221
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:06,040
I mean, kind of.


222
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:10,040
The ITF section is being discussed.


223
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:15,040
So the ITF is, it looks like ramping up a multi-formats working group, but that is just


224
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:16,040
for multi-formats.


225
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:21,320
It's not this tiny fraction of the stack.


226
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:26,760
But we do need to get our act together in terms of like finding chairs for it, figuring


227
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:30,320
out who's going to edit the specs, provide input.


228
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:35,520
At the very least, we need people to review the specs and help with that.


229
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:37,240
But that is one section.


230
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:41,240
But then there's the, what do we do with all the other specs that we have or that we should


231
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:46,920
have or all the parts of the stack that exist but don't have a spec?


232
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:54,600
Do we just like get LIDL to write all of them?


233
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:56,720
Or do we develop a system where...


234
00:15:56,720 --> 00:16:02,880
I've been told that if I stop fucking around with mascot shaped stickers and just buckle


235
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:09,360
down and make hexagon shaped stickers for UCAN, then like it'll just automatically be


236
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:12,480
part of the IPFS universe.


237
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:13,480
Is this true?


238
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:14,480
Okay, great.


239
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:15,760
Okay, done.


240
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:19,120
Standards equal LIDL plus stickers.


241
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:20,760
Right.


242
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:22,400
Yeah.


243
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:24,120
Okay.


244
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:26,440
Fantastic.


245
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:29,080
And I think, yeah, just putting that down there because there's standards, standard


246
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:33,800
quotation mark, like it's both something that we shouldn't be afraid of being like, oh,


247
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:36,880
let's do a pattern of writing stuff down.


248
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:40,360
And again, some of that might come out of a hack project where we have something that


249
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:42,840
works and then, oh, we want more people working on it.


250
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:50,480
And this tension between I wrote some open source code and cool, can three or four other


251
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:56,560
organizations implement it because they like crabs better than gophers or whatever reason


252
00:16:56,560 --> 00:17:00,260
they might want to do it, sort of thing like that.


253
00:17:00,260 --> 00:17:02,360
And part of that can be like expectations, right?


254
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:09,320
So for instance, it's not perfect, but when a browser vendor ships a new technology that


255
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:14,600
they haven't even sort of like slightly contributed to the standards process, people scream at


256
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:15,600
them.


257
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:19,000
It doesn't stop them completely, but there's a cultural expectation that if you're going


258
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:22,840
to add a feature, you should at least like pretend to have a spec and give it to the


259
00:17:22,840 --> 00:17:26,000
community, which is better than not even bothering.


260
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:29,640
And I don't think we have that muscle developed yet.


261
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:35,920
I think we don't want to stop people from coming up with ideas and trying stuff out.


262
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:42,760
But if you're going to add a significant feature and put it somehow in public where it's going


263
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:46,680
to be used by people, it's probably a good idea to develop the expectation that it should


264
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:51,360
be at least the outline of some kind of markdown spec and we make it pretty easy for people


265
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:52,360
to write specs.


266
00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:59,720
So I think that should be an expectation that we grow to develop.


267
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:09,880
Thoughts, pains, delight around this word standards.


268
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:15,800
You should add this into your threat model for capture because I've seen so many open


269
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:22,240
source projects who started at the standards place and suddenly Microsoft comes in and


270
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:24,400
is like, oh, we're building Ion, right?


271
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:28,880
We're going to do this thing you call decentralized identity.


272
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:35,640
And since this group has not actually written a spec, there's no reference implementation,


273
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:41,840
we're going to push this standard in a direction that makes it only Microsoft who can do it.


274
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:48,600
So I think the one thing to keep in mind is we have a lot of technical advancement already.


275
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:51,640
We have a lot of specs we still need to write.


276
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:52,640
Look at Lidl.


277
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:59,440
He literally just said we should write some more specs in the previous meeting.


278
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:04,760
But anyway, there is this tension of do we implement it first and then write it down


279
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:08,580
and show the world that this solves a problem and this is what we're going to do?


280
00:19:08,580 --> 00:19:12,360
Or do we go to the standards body and incorporate feedback as we design?


281
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:13,800
There's always tension there.


282
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:21,080
I think the rule of thumb is yes for protocols, no for implementations or no for anything


283
00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:25,440
that would be considered implementation detail.


284
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:30,160
And that's where something like the decentralized identity and the CCG working group just went


285
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:31,200
off.


286
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:35,920
They went down the rabbit hole of all these little implementation details.


287
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:40,480
And I don't know that anybody uses CCG standards much.


288
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:44,920
We have tiny little bits of dits here, but they have all kinds of problems because of


289
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:48,000
it.


290
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:57,360
Maybe like potential mitigation here is to not just write text, not just write prose,


291
00:19:57,360 --> 00:20:18,240
but also have a system when it's needed.


292
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:06,600
there's an expectation of having a working code with your spec proposal, kind of like reference implementation.


293
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:16,200
And then as a part of the ratification process, have expectation of some sort of a test suit that's vendor agnostic.


294
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:25,400
And we are trying to prototype a process like that for the gateway specs, where we have expectation you, there's a spec.


295
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:33,800
So one thing you need to have a spec, then you can have IPIP's improvement proposals, deltas against the spec.


296
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:42,300
And when you want to propose a change, you come in with code and then as a part of ratification process,


297
00:20:42,300 --> 00:20:51,100
you are expected to also bring test fixtures to this vendor agnostic test suit.


298
00:20:51,100 --> 00:20:56,300
For the gateway, it's fairly easy HTTP. For other things, it may be more tricky,


299
00:20:56,300 --> 00:21:07,700
but I think this is a forcing function for people from the wider ecosystem to get an early warning where there's a capture attempt.


300
00:21:07,700 --> 00:21:16,100
Because the moment I'm not able to like test it with the provided fixtures because it relies on some centralized thing


301
00:21:16,100 --> 00:21:20,600
or some proprietary thing that I'm not able to implement because of patents or whatever.


302
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:28,600
That's the early warning. That's the time when you have a warning before you ratify the spec, before it gets like too far.


303
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:30,100
I agree.


304
00:21:30,100 --> 00:21:39,000
You know, that's a good point. I mean, it's certainly true that defending against capture in standards is a problem


305
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:45,000
that we sadly have a lot of experience with based on the W3C, for instance.


306
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:58,000
I do think that ties to a broader discussion about how to organize the community and what happens when things start to become successful


307
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:01,000
and how do you scale your governance to match success.


308
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:09,000
A lot of the time you see projects that begin and the governance is basically just norms.


309
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:13,000
You have norms of how you're supposed to contribute and how you're supposed to participate.


310
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:20,000
And that's great so long as no one's income relies on it and so long as it's not too successful.


311
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:27,000
You know, like I don't want to do a thing that will make Boris angry at me, so I do the right thing.


312
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:32,000
But at some point it becomes big. Like my income depends on it.


313
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:39,000
And if it depends on doing something that makes Boris unhappy, well, maybe that makes me sad, but I'll still do it.


314
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:45,000
And then you get something that falls apart and that is easily captured because you need to go from norms to rules


315
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:49,000
and something that has a lot more enforcement capacity in it.


316
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:56,000
I wanted to point out actually, that's an excellent proposal of talking about that process.


317
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:00,000
Who funds that?


318
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:03,000
The infrastructure contest or the people who are...


319
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:07,000
Wait, wait, Mike, Mike, Mike, Mike, Mike.


320
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:11,000
I'm an indie hacker who would like to do a new thing.


321
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:17,000
And I can't possibly do all of those things as the first step.


322
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,000
And I don't think we should even dig into it.


323
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:23,000
This is the prompt of like, that sounds awesome.


324
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:31,000
So I can get some contributions to get all of that stuff done that's not me, the indie hacker or other things like that.


325
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:36,000
And this is some of the tensions of where some of this lives and what base infrastructure is.


326
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:40,000
To what you were saying in terms of the diff and other things like that,


327
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:46,000
what we really found is I think the ITF model of rough consensus and running code is a good starting point.


328
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:49,000
We went to the diff.


329
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:55,000
We'd done a bunch of early stuff with DIDs and we went there and did a demo for them.


330
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,000
They're like, oh, wait, this is working?


331
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:00,000
I'm like, yes.


332
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,000
And then we got into some discussions.


333
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:07,000
We found a lot of people there had thought a lot about identity and a bunch of other things like that.


334
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,000
But it was theoretical.


335
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:17,000
And so we didn't actually have a partner to do, for instance, interop testing with where the expectation was kind of like,


336
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:20,000
well, we'll write it all down, including some of us who had written code.


337
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:28,000
We're like, that is not going to be useful to implement or hard to implement in code.


338
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:32,000
So some of those tensions were, I would say, almost there.


339
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:40,000
Like, I start very early on in saying, I guess, intent to implement is sort of a thing that I almost,


340
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:46,000
it's just something that I know lots of people who are more into the W3C are twitching when I say that phrase sort of thing.


341
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:49,000
But I'm like, could we use some patterns and say, oh, I'm going to stick up my hand.


342
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:58,000
Yes, my org group, individual indie hacker would also like to run, deploy or code X.


343
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:03,000
And that kicks things off of saying, like, it's not just a single entity as an example.


344
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:10,000
Yeah. And I think, I'm not sure if that's where you're going, but I think parts of the standards,


345
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:18,000
it's like specs plus framework of testing that it's not, there's like no lock in around this test framework.


346
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:25,000
So the thing is, yet another example of the gateway conformance tests, we are prototyping the entire,


347
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:34,000
like the design decisions that we wrote down was, everyone, we should be able to run this on the canonical place


348
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,000
where people can compare implementations.


349
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:40,000
Then each implementation, it can run it in their own infra.


350
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:51,000
And then every end user could use it to empower themselves and verify products that provide gateways.


351
00:25:51,000 --> 00:26:04,000
So the test capture and making sure it's locked open and not tied to a specific implementation is very important.


352
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:10,000
We struggle with that because the gateway implementations right now are mostly PL driven,


353
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:14,000
but through the project, we are in other places, we are able to, like,


354
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:17,000
at least we have multiple implementations with different limitations.


355
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:19,000
So that's a starting point.


356
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:25,000
And tests are a good way of getting community participation because, you know,


357
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:29,000
hackers can easily like go like, oh, this is a test suite.


358
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:33,000
I understand how this works and I can contribute something.


359
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:40,000
And in general, I've seen quite a bit of success in standards worlds where you make it easy for people to contribute tests


360
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,000
when they find a bug.


361
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:46,000
And they do because it's a great way of getting other people to fix the bug and to do the work for you.


362
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:49,000
So that is a helpful vector for sure.


363
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,000
So we've gone deep on the first one.


364
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:57,000
What I'd actually like to do is do a speed run of adding a little more color to each one of these things mean,


365
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:02,000
and then also just getting a kind of show of hands of which of these things are interesting that we might dig into.


366
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:07,000
Because a lot of these are just prompts for us to be like, oh, right, these are some people who are interested in this stuff.


367
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,000
Let's keep talking about it.


368
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:18,000
So network operations, and kind of put bad bits in there directly to say what Robin said about, like, oh, you know,


369
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:25,000
we don't want the main IPFS commons network.


370
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:34,000
Does anyone, I call it main net, borrowing from blockchains who have this concept.


371
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:44,000
And so an open question, is there a label for the main public reachable IPFS commons network?


372
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,000
Oh, that's like an open slot.


373
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,000
We are looking for a name for DHT.


374
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:53,000
But now it seems that we also need a name for the entire network.


375
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,000
So we need two names.


376
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:56,000
And logos.


377
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,000
Do we need two names?


378
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:00,000
Because do we need to name the DHT separately from the?


379
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,000
I don't know.


380
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:06,000
There was a proposal to call it Baba Yaga yesterday.


381
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:09,000
Plus one for vilification.


382
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,000
Literally.


383
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:12,000
Awesome.


384
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,000
That's really, that's really.


385
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:20,000
So, and then there's the actual network operations where some of the stuff that Rob and I have been looking at in the decentralized data compliance group


386
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:29,000
that we'll talk about this afternoon is like, okay, real companies that are registered in real countries are going to run real servers


387
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:35,000
as part of stuff that they run and where they operate those things, they have compliance needs.


388
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:41,000
Hey, instead of everyone having to do this all by themselves, can we cooperate and help each other out


389
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:44,000
so not everyone is starting from scratch,


390
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:50,000
including some shared compliance things around which bad bits we might not be allowed to serve.


391
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:56,000
So this is a guard as a community against the vilification.


392
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:57,000
Yep. Yep. Right.


393
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:02,000
And I think we're seeing the IPFS operators group kind of reboot and that'll hopefully kind of find a home in there.


394
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:06,000
But they're probably not that not the same set of people who are looking at compliance.


395
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,000
So like that.


396
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,000
I mean, the two work together.


397
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,000
But yeah.


398
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:20,000
Open source governance, a placeholder that is more about the code and goes into in the current model that we have,


399
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:23,000
where lots of code gets written by PL.


400
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:31,000
What is PL's approach to saying to taking feature requests or taking PRs or not taking PRs?


401
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:34,000
There's a bunch of different ways to do this and what this looks like.


402
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:42,000
Some of it is once again tied to funding as a form of power that you have to think about as well,


403
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,000
which is why I have that one as the next thing.


404
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:47,000
We have a bunch of things in motion.


405
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:50,000
There's an IPFS fund being formed.


406
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:53,000
Addy, is that going to be talked about here?


407
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:56,000
There's more than one.


408
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,000
There's more than one?


409
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,000
Okay.


410
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:03,000
Is that on the schedule anywhere?


411
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:10,000
There was a little bit touched upon in the keynote.


412
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:13,000
So we have two sort of divergences.


413
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:18,000
We have one that is the traditional IPFS fund, which I'm dubbing the Web 2.0 version.


414
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:22,000
And then we're building out a Web 3 version, which is all on chain.


415
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:27,000
So it's like based off of staking mechanism and pooling on GILF.


416
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:34,000
And then those will be fractionalized using quadratic voting or some kind of weighted voting scheme with governance


417
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:40,000
so that everything is on chain and essentially trackable and traceable for both the community and the funders,


418
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:46,000
with the idea being that the funding will be completely decentralized so it's not coming from a single entity.


419
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:53,000
And the hopes there is that we can then fund and allocate money to higher risk, higher reward projects.


420
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:56,000
So I don't know if that answers the question.


421
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:59,000
But there's sort of two tracks right now that are going in parallel.


422
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:00,000
That's amazing.


423
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:05,000
Like, again, this entire track is a honeypot for people with information and people with questions, right?


424
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:10,000
So even though like, oh, we need two names for the thing, we're having it recorded.


425
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:16,000
So this is the kind of thing where I'd love to follow up and be like, where do we go to follow along, find out more?


426
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:22,000
What is the Filecoin Slack channel or, you know, hashtag on Blue Sky to follow or whatever?


427
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:23,000
So that's awesome.


428
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:24,000
Thank you.


429
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:28,000
Evangelism and Ground Game.


430
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:34,000
So that's something that Yuni wants to cover a fair bit this afternoon and she's not here yet.


431
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:42,000
In a couple of different ways, which is, again, so to what you were saying in terms of like, it has to be useful to people generally,


432
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:48,000
which might start with cool technical hack that incites a community to keep going and sort of thing,


433
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:56,000
but then has to transition to exactly what Eddie was saying about like, hey, how about we use some languages other than English


434
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:59,000
and think about places other than the Western world?


435
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:08,000
I had an amazing discussion with some Mayan activists at IPFS camp, and they told me a little bit of like,


436
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:16,000
once we translate it into our language, here's some of our thoughts on how IPFS is or is not connected to some other things


437
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,000
and how it makes us feel.


438
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:21,000
And I'm like, super interesting, right?


439
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:27,000
So all of these, like, we have to do all of these things to some degree.


440
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:30,000
And some of this is like, great.


441
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:35,000
So there's these two parts of governance is in part the like, who decides or who prioritizes?


442
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:38,000
And community is the, in part, great.


443
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:45,000
How do we work together and do some collective action around it instead of just single individual or single org?


444
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:48,000
Yep.


445
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:53,000
I was just going to point out that the cool thing about the open source governance and evangelism and ground game,


446
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:57,000
and to some degree funding, these are well-trodden paths, right?


447
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:02,000
There's been a lot of success in the last 20 years for, you know, like Mozilla, Linux Foundation, lots of these.


448
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:05,000
And then, you know, even the IEEE is really good at this.


449
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:11,000
And so I think we should make sure that we go at this not thinking we're going to make a PL-flavored version of it.


450
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:22,000
I think we should definitely maybe organize a conversation around doing like a SWOT on what Mozilla did or what Linux Foundation did.


451
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:26,000
And pull from them, like learn from the people who have come before us.


452
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:30,000
Because we certainly have something to add to this.


453
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:36,000
You know, what Addy's talking about, you know, cutting new paths into Web 3 funding and how do we do voting?


454
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:41,000
And how do we do everything on-chain and transparently?


455
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:49,000
But to get there, right, there's so much we're going to need to do that has already been figured out.


456
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:57,000
So let's not spin our wheels on that. Let's work on, you know, the cool stuff that we can add.


457
00:33:57,000 --> 00:34:00,000
Your laptop did not like staying.


458
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:06,000
Yeah, completely agree. I mean, two examples come to mind there.


459
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:10,000
Not necessarily fully successful, but that have interesting properties at least.


460
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:16,000
One is Wikipedia developed a pretty serious, like, ground game.


461
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:23,000
And everyone knows how bureaucratic and complicated it is to actually make Wikipedia function.


462
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:31,000
And that was a key part in getting an entire community to understand a very complex set of rules to build governance around a shared system.


463
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:38,000
That, you know, maybe bureaucratic, maybe difficult and painful, but generally works more than it doesn't.


464
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:45,000
And the other is ISOC, where they manage a pretty significant budget annually.


465
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:55,000
And I think it's a very significant chunk, maybe half, at least a third, possibly more than half of the budget is managed by ISOC chapters.


466
00:34:55,000 --> 00:35:01,000
And so I'm not convinced that the community representation they have is very representative.


467
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:07,000
But at least they figured out a way of doing this kind of collective budgeting.


468
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:16,000
I actually 80% disagree with almost everything that you said.


469
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:22,000
Here's what I've seen having practiced a bunch of this stuff 20 years ago when open source was still a radical act.


470
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:28,000
I think those orgs figured it out from the early 2000s to today.


471
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:35,000
What I'm seeing is essentially open source 2.0, where a lot of people have come up without it being radical


472
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:38,000
and don't actually know how to practice.


473
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:43,000
Another point is you said PL. I believe you meant PLN, of course, right?


474
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:49,000
This is a problem that we generally have in the N part.


475
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:56,000
We don't talk about the N part, in part because of point four of funding where most of the locus of that lies.


476
00:35:56,000 --> 00:36:06,000
I think a lot of the new stuff coming from Web 3.0 is super new and no one really has it figured out.


477
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,000
And there's some new techniques in there, right?


478
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:15,000
So how do we split these things and go double down on the things that we know that work that might target certain types of orgs?


479
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:20,000
Or I actually see that a bunch of those techniques work in the global northern west


480
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:26,000
and pretty much don't in the global south and southeast Asia.


481
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:31,000
And that's really the arc of, oh no, the Internet is now worldwide


482
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:37,000
and our ground game actually has to be global and not just English-centric, right?


483
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:43,000
So I'm not disagreeing, more saying, yes, and.


484
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:47,000
What I was thinking about is exactly what you were saying.


485
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:53,000
If you had me write down a list of the things that I admire from previous organizations,


486
00:36:53,000 --> 00:37:00,000
I think the people who know anything about Mozilla would say the one thing they are really good at is translating.


487
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:06,000
They have all their documentation and all their educational material in like 80 different languages.


488
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:09,000
So I agree with you, Boris.


489
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:14,000
I'm not trying to be sort of like the global west-north-centric.


490
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:19,000
In fact, there are some things about some of these organizations that are so good about the global south


491
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:22,000
and getting it into places.


492
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:28,000
The IEEE does a really good ground game with institutions, educational institutions.


493
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,000
They're like a PhD factory.


494
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:35,000
And there is so much of what we're doing that it has open-ended questions,


495
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:41,000
like things that could fuel and also fund a lot of research.


496
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:44,000
And so anyway, that's what I'm thinking.


497
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:47,000
I think you and I agree we're saying the same thing.


498
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:51,000
I'm not thinking like, oh, you know, let's throw giant parties in New York City.


499
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:52,000
I'm thinking let's –


500
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,000
I'm not against it.


501
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:59,000
I'm not asking you to make a rule that's like a law.


502
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:04,000
My vision here is having a presence on the ground pretty much everywhere in the world


503
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:09,000
with people who are speaking in a native language and teaching people how to build with this.


504
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:15,000
That's an amazing mission statement and I think very good for UD's session.


505
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:17,000
Thank you for pushing back, though.


506
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:19,000
I love it.


507
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:22,000
Of course, we're over time now.


508
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:28,000
Let's quickly flip through the working group.


509
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:32,000
So having gone through –


510
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:39,000
one thing that we wanted to bring forward here is that there's this sort of like novel idea,


511
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:45,000
that novelish idea that's been floating around and where people are sprouting up working groups here and there.


512
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:49,000
And it's great because we should be working and in groups.


513
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:53,000
So you figured out that that should be a good idea.


514
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:59,000
But the purpose of working groups is to get us cross-organizationally to figure things out,


515
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:02,000
and they can have different types of approaches to different things.


516
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:06,000
Some of them are much more like pragmatic solving things.


517
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:10,000
Others are like let's organize towards a mission.


518
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:17,000
But we haven't really formalized this in any way or figured out what are the rules


519
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:20,000
and what does a working group need to be.


520
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:26,000
So I think we should be thinking as a community about what do we expect from a working group


521
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:29,000
and what should we bring into working groups.


522
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:36,000
And so there are basic building blocks like it should have a charter, it should be there for a purpose.


523
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:44,000
It should also know from the start when it stops to exist because you don't want these things to just live on forever for no reason.


524
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:50,000
They should have some communication channels that are where the community will expect to find them.


525
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:57,000
Today, if you wanted to find out all of the working groups that exist around the IPFS thing,


526
00:39:57,000 --> 00:40:22,000
I have no fucking clue how you would go about it.


527
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:05,200
I'm not even sure that if we put all of our brains together in this room, we would succeed in listing all of them.


528
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:08,800
I think we'd probably forget some. There are probably some that we just don't know about.


529
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:16,800
Well, you have access to the secret V2 notion where all of this information is stored, don't you?


530
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:20,200
I thought that was in the secret V3 notion.


531
00:40:20,200 --> 00:40:23,200
That was a PL joke from someone who's on the outside.


532
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:37,800
None of this should be shocking or particularly revolutionary, but this is basically how it's done


533
00:40:37,800 --> 00:40:43,000
and the kind of thing that we should figure out how to normalize and have a list of them, for instance,


534
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:46,600
and how maybe they could share a code of conduct and stuff like that.


535
00:40:46,600 --> 00:40:54,000
And so this brings the question that's always horrendous, is do we need standards for standards?


536
00:40:54,000 --> 00:41:03,200
And the answer, sadly, is usually yes, much as you want to punch yourself in the face as you say these things.


537
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:10,600
But we probably need a working group working group of some kind.


538
00:41:10,600 --> 00:41:16,200
Not that it should be an intensive amount of work. Ideally, this should be a very lightweight affair.


539
00:41:16,200 --> 00:41:23,200
But some group that basically sets out these things. When do you start a new one?


540
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:28,600
Where do we put the list of all of them? What tools should they have? And that kind of stuff.


541
00:41:28,600 --> 00:41:33,800
How do you announce and promote your working group so that it's not just you and the friends you met at the bar last night


542
00:41:33,800 --> 00:41:37,600
who had a great idea, but also other people in the community who might be interested?


543
00:41:37,600 --> 00:41:45,000
And really, the idea is how do we make this an effective structure that people can get off the shelf,


544
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:53,000
use to solve a problem, put back on the shelf when the problem is solved, and not become some big bureaucratic nightmare.


545
00:41:53,000 --> 00:42:00,000
Moving on now, Enrique, what we're going to do next is, so we've got a channel in IPFS Slack.


546
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:04,600
I will take a bunch of these open things and some of the notes that I captured and tag some names of people,


547
00:42:04,600 --> 00:42:08,200
get a HackMD up so that we can use that throughout the day for some of these other things,


548
00:42:08,200 --> 00:42:14,200
along with communicating with all the speakers, which I did not do ahead of time


549
00:42:14,200 --> 00:42:19,600
because we were running a little late in the massive atom in the sky last night.


550
00:42:19,600 --> 00:42:25,200
That's great. This is recorded. Thank you very much. Enrique is up next.


551
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:45,200
Thank you.
