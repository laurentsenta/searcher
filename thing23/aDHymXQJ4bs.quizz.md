## List all the weak signals of things an almighty AI could do to improve the presenter's life

- Improve the demo preparation and presentation: Presenter had difficulties with font size and mic holding during demo
- Enhance the infrastructure and testing for performance metrics: Performance benchmark data was not ready to be shared during the presentation

## List all the weak signals of things that are already great in the presenter's life

- Libp2p's NAT traversal and building blocks: Libp2p offers ready-to-use components like Cademlia DHT and GossipSub, as well as NAT traversal which improves developers' experience
- Interoperability of ZigLip2P: Despite being a lean implementation, it is able to interoperate with other QUIC Libp2p nodes, expanding its potential use
- Community participation and collaboration: The development and testing of ZigLip2P are happening within the open-source community, encouraging joint efforts and knowledge sharing
- Focus on performance from day one in ZigLip2P: This lean Libp2p stack is designed to rely on performance-focused solutions like MSQUIC, aiming for a performant and lightweight implementation
