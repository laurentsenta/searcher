00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:13,680
Welcome to the Boris and Robin Community and Governance show. We have a ton of short sessions


2
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:19,880
throughout the day. We're getting kicked off with this in to collect and share a bunch


3
00:00:19,880 --> 00:00:25,960
of other things that fit into this incredibly broad topic of community and governance. It's


4
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:31,400
super awesome that we have a bunch of natural formation and interest in this area and want


5
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:36,920
to see more gathering around it and make it very clear that everything from this event


6
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:46,720
to the operations of the wider IPFS and Filecoin cinematic universe is up to all of us and


7
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:52,520
figuring out how to recruit more people to work on these topics.


8
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:57,360
We just finished these slides, so each one of them will be a bit of a surprise to us


9
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:02,160
as well. But thankfully we made it look professional


10
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:09,040
by color coordinating in the morning, so I hope you appreciate that touch at the very


11
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:11,240
least. So this is our schedule for the day. This


12
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:18,160
is the opening discussion that you're in. At 10.50 Enrique will talk about interplanetary


13
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:29,360
specs, Lidl about specs repo and IPIPs. At 11.30 Bastien will talk about star maps. 11.50


14
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:36,120
Cade memory and uncertainty, IPFS and digital preservation in the multi-crisis present.


15
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:44,440
Is that a long way of saying we're fucked? With better words.


16
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:49,200
Yes, exactly. In the afternoon after lunch we're back in


17
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:55,560
here again for some short talks. Open source governance, funding, etc. and the schedule


18
00:01:55,560 --> 00:02:00,280
says bore us to figure out. It's 15 minutes. What I want to talk about


19
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:04,760
there is actually just where are we at in this concept of open source, how do we do


20
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:09,600
the funding and then like the etc. is actually where all the important stuff hides. So come


21
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:11,840
to my talk. So you have figured it out.


22
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:19,720
Yeah, totally. Robin is going to give an update on the decentralized data compliance working


23
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:24,960
group. Don't you love to have all these words together?


24
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:33,000
Exactly, yes, exactly. Uni wants to make it very clear that IPFS comp is coming. It's


25
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:38,120
in November which is basically tomorrow in event planning world. So if we want to work


26
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:43,040
on it, we got to start basically working on it now and almost like a kick off for participation


27
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:50,280
in that. And after that we'll round out the day also guided by Uni which is basically


28
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:57,680
how do we spread the love of IPFS worldwide, what's our ground game and more events and


29
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:05,560
really decentralizing the way that we do events for having people participate in between larger


30
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:11,080
events like this one.
