## Overview

In this talk, Aarsh Shah introduces Caboose, a library that serves as a retrieval client for server applications aiming to retrieve content from the Saturn Decentralized CDN (DCDN) network. Caboose simplifies the retrieval process by enabling speedy and reliable downloads, supporting fetching of blocks and CARs, and can be used as a network measurement tool. 

## Current Implementation

Caboose currently has a Golang beta implementation, which can be found on GitHub at [Filecoin-Saturn-Caboose](https://github.com/filecoin-project/go-caboose). It is already being used by the Bifrost Gateway for Project Rhea to retrieve content from Saturn. The beta implementation offers features like consistent hashing of L1s, ranking based on observed retrieval latency and correctness, failure recovery and backup, and comprehensive metrics collection.

## Challenges and Future Work

Building Caboose on top of a distributed system, where nodes frequently join and leave the network and have varying levels of reliability and speed, is not trivial. As such, the team is constantly tuning the ranking algorithm to improve performance. They are currently working on improving the ranking algorithm, fixing possible bottlenecks in Saturn, and monitoring metrics to ensure optimal coverage and performance.

## Key Takeaways

- Caboose is a library designed to simplify the retrieval of content from the Saturn DCDN network.
- It has a Golang beta implementation and is actively being developed and improved.
- Caboose serves as a network measurement tool, allowing developers to monitor performance and optimize their applications running on the Saturn network.
- Future improvements include an enhanced ranking algorithm and possible support for languages like Rust and JavaScript.
