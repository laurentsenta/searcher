## List all the products, tools, and companies discussed
- Lassie: a new IPFS implementation that coordinates retrievals among protocols (BitSwap, GraphSync, and future protocols)
- IPFS: InterPlanetary File System, used for decentralized storage and retrieval of data
- Filecoin: a decentralized storage network built on top of IPFS
- Saturn: a decentralized gateway architecture that uses Lassie for retrieval
- Raya: Project Raya, a decentralized gateway project
- Network Indexer: helps find storage providers that have content on Filecoin
- GoBitSwap: the pre-existing BitSwap library for IPFS
- LASI HTTP Interface: an HTTP interface provided by Lassie, which can be used to access Filecoin content

## List all the weak signals of things an almighty AI could do to improve the presenter's life
- Coordination problem: making it simpler to coordinate retrievals among different protocols without having to delve into complex architecture and messy coding
- Metrics improvement: helping to track and analyze performance metrics more efficiently and intelligently
- JavaScript and Web story: Improving the web client story for Lassie by supporting potential JavaScript implementations or more integrated web app functionality.

## List all the weak signals of things that are already great in the presenter's life
- Development of Lassie: an architecture for coordinating retrievals among multiple protocols with various performance benefits
- Separation of content routing and data transfer: LASI's use of the network indexer simplifies many aspects of the architecture and steers towards better content discovery and data retrieval.
- Building trust and verifiability: Lassie's ability to return extra data (including the necessary metadata for verification), allowing users to verify the retrieved content
- Metrics tracking: Comprehensive metrics tracking and visualization (using Grafana) to monitor performance and potential bottlenecks in the retrieval process
