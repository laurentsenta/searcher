## Overview

In this video, Addie Wagenknecht introduces the IPFS (InterPlanetary File System) Fund and explains its impact on the development and growth of the IPFS community. Additionally, Addie presents the IPFS Community Impact Awards and shares her work on blockchain mechanisms for funding allocation.

## IPFS Fund Overview

The IPFS Fund has been working to transform the IPFS infrastructure, bringing it from primary implementations to implementations that meet the growing needs of users, such as artists, developers, and people working in IoT space. Their main goal is to accelerate and catalyze the development of IPFS implementation and ensure high impact teams build and grow. The IPFS Fund has already committed a significant amount of resources to this cause and is looking for additional funding.

One of the key projects mentioned in the video is the 3S game development studio, which built an Unreal Unity plugin that allows easy organization and sharing of game assets using IPFS. This plugin has been installed over 15,000 times in just two months.

## IPFS Team and Goals

The core team working on IPFS Fund includes Addie, Evan, and Mauro, all of whom have backgrounds in research, open hardware, and blockchain. Additionally, Dietrich, Mosh, Juan, and Molly have played essential roles in driving the IPFS Fund.

Addie also introduced her work on solving the issue of funding allocation using blockchain mechanisms. The aim is to develop proactive, real-time distribution systems so that public goods, like IPFS and the Filecoin FEM community, can be funded more easily and accurately.

## IPFS Community Impact Awards

The IPFS Community Impact Awards are granted every six months to projects that have been submitted and voted on by the community. Congratulations are extended to the 28 winners in this cycle, with special thanks given to the community for their submissions and votes. These awards serve as a way to thank and reward individuals for their contributions and for building projects that advance the IPFS community.
