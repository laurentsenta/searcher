1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,340
so hey we're Robin and Boris and we're doing the community and governance track


2
00:00:10,340 --> 00:00:16,520
what do these have in common well they're both about people and basically


3
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:20,740
what we're doing here is sociotechnical systems including things like what is


4
00:00:20,740 --> 00:00:26,340
ipfs so and if we're building open source that's great and who pays for it


5
00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:29,840
And how do we agree or disagree on how various things work?


6
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:32,340
Everything from a bad hash list to,


7
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:34,840
let's talk to some regulators.


8
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:37,040
And that's about it. It's going to be awesome.


9
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:39,040
Come see us.


10
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:43,740
All right. I'm Ryan.


11
00:00:43,740 --> 00:00:48,240
I'm doing the integrating IPFS track on Monday morning.


12
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:49,540
Why is this important?


13
00:00:49,540 --> 00:00:51,940
Well, what good is all your beautiful data


14
00:00:51,940 --> 00:00:54,440
if it's just stuck in IPFS?


15
00:00:54,440 --> 00:00:57,740
You know, within our network, we have to get it out to other places, right?


16
00:00:57,740 --> 00:00:59,540
For it to really be meaningful.


17
00:00:59,540 --> 00:01:05,240
So we're going to talk about integrations with space and mobile and you can.


18
00:01:05,240 --> 00:01:09,140
And yeah, just finding ways to get IPFS data outside of IPFS


19
00:01:09,140 --> 00:01:13,640
and using it in meaningful ways.


20
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:15,140
Hello, I'm Yanis.


21
00:01:15,140 --> 00:01:17,540
I'm leading the measuring IPFS track,


22
00:01:17,540 --> 00:01:20,340
which I already introduced here in the beginning.


23
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:25,640
So I'll give some time back because you know what it's going to be about.


24
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:26,640
We've got lots of talks.


25
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:30,740
If you want to figure out if IPFS is good for video streaming,


26
00:01:30,740 --> 00:01:33,140
live video streaming, come along.


27
00:01:33,140 --> 00:01:38,440
If you want to know why IRO is so fast as it is, come along.


28
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:40,940
We'll probably hear about that as well.


29
00:01:40,940 --> 00:01:46,540
If you want to see what BitSwap does in terms of finding content in the network,


30
00:01:46,540 --> 00:01:49,940
in terms of the content discovery capabilities, come along.


31
00:01:49,940 --> 00:01:54,140
And there are a few more things that I'm not going to tell you now


32
00:01:54,140 --> 00:01:57,140
because they're secret.


33
00:01:57,140 --> 00:02:02,740
Hi, everyone.


34
00:02:02,740 --> 00:02:05,740
I'm leading the track called Show and Tell.


35
00:02:05,740 --> 00:02:09,240
It's on the last day in the afternoon.


36
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:14,140
So if throughout IPFS thing you've had a yes, it worked moment


37
00:02:14,140 --> 00:02:17,740
or say you're planning to, oh, I'm going to make it work moment


38
00:02:17,740 --> 00:02:22,540
and you want to come talk about it for five to ten minutes, reach out to me.


39
00:02:22,540 --> 00:02:28,540
You can DM me on IPFS things slack or on the unconf sessions sheet.


40
00:02:28,540 --> 00:02:30,240
There is an application link.


41
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:33,440
It just asks for your name and talk title.


42
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:34,240
Fill that out.


43
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:39,540
Thank you.


44
00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:41,240
I'm Will again.


45
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:44,840
I will be leading the HTTP gateways talk on Monday.


46
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:51,240
We will talk about all things gateways and HTTP interop in various forms to IPFS.


47
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:55,440
A lot of great talks, both subcomponent talks in Rhea,


48
00:02:55,440 --> 00:03:01,940
but also other approaches to what gateways could, can, will be.


49
00:03:01,940 --> 00:03:08,740
I also am here to pitch the decentralized compute and AI track, which is on Monday.


50
00:03:08,740 --> 00:03:11,240
I am not, Irina, but she's not here yet.


51
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:17,840
So if you are interested in VMs in any form and how the compute happens,


52
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:24,140
where the data is, and how we might have some sort of WASM thing in IPFS


53
00:03:24,140 --> 00:03:29,640
or around IPFS or otherwise stapled against IPFS,


54
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:39,840
there will be a whole range of talks to that effect on Monday that will be very exciting.


55
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:41,240
Hey, everyone.


56
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:43,340
I'm Hannah again.


57
00:03:43,340 --> 00:03:47,940
I am leading the data transfer Thunderdome track.


58
00:03:47,940 --> 00:03:51,040
Five protocols enter, one will leave.


59
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:54,940
And basically, it's actually a really awesome track.


60
00:03:54,940 --> 00:03:59,740
We have a, we're going to have talks on a number of new data transfer protocols.


61
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:05,140
We're going to have a bunch of talks on how to actually make data transfer protocols work together,


62
00:04:05,140 --> 00:04:08,940
how we can actually all work together instead of just fighting.


63
00:04:08,940 --> 00:04:13,140
And it's going to be really awesome.


64
00:04:13,140 --> 00:04:17,340
And I think a bunch of the talks that you saw announced during the keynote coming up are there.


65
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:21,540
And it's happening today in, I believe, the Luxembourg room.


66
00:04:21,540 --> 00:04:23,040
But I could be wrong about that.


67
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:26,840
If you end up in somebody else's track, I'm sure it'll be good, too.


68
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:30,140
So, yes, come to it at 11.


69
00:04:30,140 --> 00:04:34,940
Yay.


70
00:04:34,940 --> 00:04:35,340
All right.


71
00:04:35,340 --> 00:04:37,840
Hi, I'm James for the first time.


72
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:47,840
I will be leading, pause for laughter, I'll be leading the deployments and operators track in this room this afternoon.


73
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:52,940
So a lot of the discussion over the next three days is going to be about implementing and protocols.


74
00:04:52,940 --> 00:04:56,840
Some of us are foolish enough to try to actually put this into production.


75
00:04:56,840 --> 00:05:03,540
This track is for you.


76
00:05:03,540 --> 00:05:04,640
I'm J. Chris.


77
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:06,440
I'm leading the databases track.


78
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:07,940
That's going to be tomorrow.


79
00:05:07,940 --> 00:05:13,440
I think IPFS is hitting this inflection point where it's all of a sudden getting a lot easier to use and a lot more capable.


80
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:20,540
And databases are that piece of the technology stack that will take something like that and wrap it up and hand it to a user and not even tell them what's going on inside it.


81
00:05:20,540 --> 00:05:24,340
So 2023 is going to be the year of the database on IPFS.


82
00:05:24,340 --> 00:05:29,840
That's my prediction.


83
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:30,640
Hello.


84
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:32,740
Is it Sid you're looking for?


85
00:05:32,740 --> 00:05:35,140
If so, tomorrow.


86
00:05:35,140 --> 00:05:37,440
I'm so down Luxembourg rooms.


87
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:39,040
I'm leading the content routing track.


88
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:41,440
We're going to have a holistic view of the content routing.


89
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:52,740
We're going to look at what is IP and I how is it helping projects all around the IPFS network and we're going to finish it off by talking about DHT privacy for the first time.


90
00:05:52,740 --> 00:05:54,140
So please be there.


91
00:05:54,140 --> 00:05:58,840
Thank you.


92
00:05:58,840 --> 00:05:59,240
Hey, folks.


93
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:08,240
My name is Matt Hamilton just standing in here on the stage for Irina who I think is somewhere in the air between Tokyo and Brussels at the moment going back from ETH global.


94
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:15,140
I reno will be leading the decentralized compute and AI track on Monday.


95
00:06:15,140 --> 00:06:28,840
So come along if you want to find out anything more about FEM the Falcon virtual machine and things like backyow and ways in which you can use all of your beautiful data that you now have stored on the best decentralized network.


96
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:35,940
There is to do useful fun and great things and kind of move into the web 3 more of the web 3 world.


97
00:06:35,940 --> 00:06:41,440
Thanks a lot.


98
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:43,240
Hey again, everybody.


99
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:45,440
After I'm done, I think we are actually done.


100
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:48,840
I am leading the IPFS on the web track tomorrow.


101
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:52,440
It is in a room over there.


102
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:58,240
Last year when we had IPFS thing and IPFS camp, we focused on a lot of integrations of IPFS into the web platform.


103
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:12,340
But one of the things that we kind of missed out on was talking about the entire the vast spectrum of ways that people get IPFS data onto the HTTP web, publish to it and get the HTTP web onto IPFS.


104
00:07:12,340 --> 00:07:21,540
So this track is a new and expanded version of that where you're going to hear from a lot of projects that are working around running IPFS code inside HTTP web pages.


105
00:07:21,540 --> 00:07:36,040
Be able to get country address data out into those pages, things like publication pipelines, workflows and all the tooling you need to be able to work up and down backward forward inside out the HTTP stack with browsers today using IPFS data.


106
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:41,240
Thanks.
