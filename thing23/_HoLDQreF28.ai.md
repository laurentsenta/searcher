## Article

Hello everyone, I'm Bastien, a Program Manager at Fission, and today I'm going to talk to you about Starmaps, a roadmapping tool developed by Protocol Labs. 

### Benefits of a roadmap

Having a roadmap for your project can help:

- Clarify goals and objectives
- Communicate objectives and collaborate within the team
- Increase visibility to external audience
- Set timelines by estimating workload
- Define milestones
- Identify roadblocks early in the implementation process

### Introduction to Starmaps

Starmaps is a flexible tool that can be used to render different kinds of roadmaps, suitable for various team sizes and project types within the network. It fetches data from GitHub issues, conveniently eliminating the need for duplicating tasks.

### Fission's Roadmap Example

At Fission, we have three projects using Starmaps as of now. It provides a standard view of project timelines, with milestones displayed based on their Estimated Time of Arrival (ETA). Starmaps also offers three different view modes:

1. **Overview**: Displays project milestones on the timeline.
2. **Detailed View**: Shows all child issues within each milestone.
3. **Milestone View**: Breaks down the issues and progress within a specific milestone.

### Starmaps Formatting and Dependencies

Starmaps uses simple formatting within GitHub by adding a "children" list with project URLs and an ETA. Dependencies are easily added by inserting the URL of a related GitHub issue in the description.

### Roadmap Implementation Using Starmaps

To create your roadmap using Starmaps, first, carry out the roadmapping process for your project. Determine the features and set timelines accordingly. Then, create GitHub issues and format them with Starmaps. Lastly, paste your project's root node URL into Starmaps for rendering.

Resources to get started with Starmaps can be found on [starmap.site](https://starmap.site/), where you'll find a guide and templates.
