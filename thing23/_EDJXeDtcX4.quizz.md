## List all the weak signals of things an almighty AI could do to improve the presenter's life

- Reducing barriers to adoption: making it simpler for providers to publish and interact with IPNI, and enabling long-tail content providers to participate in the network.
- Exploring filtering options: allowing providers to customize the data they want to store and provide based on customer requirements.
- Addressing compatibility and integration concerns with other content routing systems: making sure IPNI can work seamlessly with existing systems such as Kubo World, DHT, and IPFS.

## List all the weak signals of things that are already great in the presenter's life

- IPNI protocol: providing efficient content routing and discovery with low latency, which serves providers better than existing systems like DHT.
- Advancements in IPNI: various extensions and improvements made to the protocol to handle content at scale, enable cascading lookups, adopt new retrieval protocols, and improve user privacy.
- Community involvement: the presenter highlights the new GitHub organization, IPNI, where developers can contribute to the project and track developments in the specifications.
- CLI for IPNI: a command-line interface that enables verification of interactions in the IPNI network, making it easier for users to test and validate their content discovery and routing.
