## Overview

In this video, Henrique Dias presents an introduction to IPFS specifications, emphasizing the importance of clear documentation and outlining the project's goals. The discussion includes standards and goals, implementing the spec generator for other projects, and future updates.

## The Importance of Standards

Standards make it easier to implement projects without having to constantly consult the codebase, and clear documentation is generally more reliable than code. By maintaining a clear track record of decisions and consensus, it becomes easier to develop better tests and bridge to other systems.

## Goals of the IPFS Spec Project

- Look good and provide visibility for specifications
- Keep things simple with mostly markdown and some addons
- Support typical specification Features, such as definition references
- Add more tooling to improve the project over time

## Tooling and Participation

The specification repository can be found at ipfs.specs.generator. You can read the _Specs for Specs_ document or simply copy-paste some spec to get started. The goal is to create a spec generator that can be used for projects outside of IPFS as well.

## What's Next and Future Additions

The immediate goal is to write more specs and improve the website, including adding dark mode. The spec generator project intends to collaborate with libp2p and multi-format projects, adopting the same spec management solution. The working group can further bolster the project by supporting the specs for specs and helping other communities adopt the approach.
