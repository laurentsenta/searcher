## List all the products, tools, and companies discussed

- BAU (hashing algorithm and data transfer protocol): an extension of the Blake 3 hashing algorithm that also persists the internal Merkle tree for more efficient data transfers.
- Arrow: the project using BAU for content-addressed storage with simple data primitives like blobs and collections.
- Number Zero: the company involved in creating BAU and Arrow.
- DeltaChat: an application using Arrow for database synchronization on mobile platforms.
- Blake 3: a fast and relatively new cryptographic hashing algorithm.

## List all the weak signals of things an almighty AI could do to improve the presenter's life

- Improved support for content-defined chunking: the current system does not have an ideal solution for content-defined chunking (e.g., Rabin fingerprinting), and it would help if there were an efficient and effective way to incorporate this feature.
- Enhanced DAG support: if an AI can come up with a more efficient way to handle deep and highly dynamic Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) in Arrow, it could make the system more versatile for various applications.
- Garbage collection: address the current lack of garbage collection for complex hierarchical collections within Arrow to ensure efficient data storage and management.

## List all the weak signals of things that are already great in the presenter's life

- Verified streaming using BAU: the BAU extension to the Blake 3 hashing algorithm has led to very efficient and secure data transfers with incremental verification, which is useful for various applications.
- Arrow's simplicity and performance: by focusing on basic data primitives like blobs and collections, Arrow has achieved fast and efficient data transfers and storage with minimal overhead and complexity.
- Successful application of Arrow in real-world projects: Arrow has already been used successfully in applications like DeltaChat for reliable and efficient data synchronization on mobile platforms.
